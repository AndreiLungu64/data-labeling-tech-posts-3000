IANAL, but you probably have to sue for ""damages"" which in this case would be money, so they could also just pay you and not give you the information you seek.  They could also prove that you did actually 'delete' the info and then the judge might throw it out.  But at least you'd get to an actual human who could help you (or at least tell you they don't have the information). http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-greenspan/why-i-sued-google-and-won_b_172403.html",2025-11-15T11:36:05.024076Z

In general Google Spreadsheets can do a lot of the same things but you may find ease of use things like some of the advanced chart and graph features that exist in Excel either don't exist and must be built, require an app from the marketplace, or are just harder to use. Google is continuously updating their product though so it will get closer. Since Google apps are free, I would spend about a 2 weeks trying out Spreadsheet.

Introduction Basically, direct messages are messages you send directly to another Twitter user ; no one else can read them , except for the recipient. However, the user you send a DM to has to follow you on Twitter . This requirement was enacted to decrease the amount of spam on Twitter. Sending a direct message There's a few ways to send a direct message: You can send one from the main What's Happening? textbox in the Twitter web interface. To do this, you type: d username message or dm username message : username is the name of the user you're sending the DM to, and message is your message. You can DM someone by going to their profile page and selecting Direct Message from the Actions button (next to the Lists button). You can hover over a user's profile picture in the timeline/inbox and select Direct Message from the Actions button. You can go to the Direct Messages tab on the Twitter home page (after you log in) and select a user. Once you do so, you can write a message as usual and click Send . Difference from @ replies In your question, you also asked how direct messages are different from posting @username ... on Twitter. The @username style is known as an @ reply . You can use it to reply to someone's tweet or just say something to them (not to a specific tweet). They are quite different from DMs: The user you @ reply to does NOT have to follow you . @ replies are NOT private . They are visible to everyone, unless your tweets are protected (private).

Is there a way to link them, so that when I log on to me@gmail.com , I still have access to me@mycompany.com services in Google? Specifically I am looking to solve this problem on Google Analytics (GA). The me@gmail.com account on GA shows my personal sites where the me@mycompany.com shows my work sites.  I'd like to log on via me@gmail.com and see both personal and work sites with the privileges of both accounts",2025-11-15T12:33:58.329379Z

If you accidentally press delete while in the trash, your messages will be gone forever . Clear your trash on your old account. Trash all your messages in your old account. Untrash a single label. Import the messages to your new account using the POP3 feature (Get mail from other accounts). Tag all these new messages with the same label you used on your old account. In your old account, trash the messages that were imported successfully. Repeat steps 2-5 for each label. Untrash your messages. This will probably only help you if you use labels as folders (i.e. one label per message). Otherwise your POP3 client will have already read messages from before and it gets messy. If you don't mind messages having the exact same tags, then it's fine. Update: I just tried it, and this should work. The reason it works is that when you put messages in the trash, two things happen: The labels are preserved. POP3 clients will not see the messages. Note: When you trash the messages from the All mail folder, the following misleading message will be shown: Moving conversations from All Mail to
  the Trash will remove them from all
  views, including labels and search
  results. This is because in Gmail, a
  conversation can be displayed in a
  variety of views, but there is only
  one copy. Are you sure you want to
  move the only copy to the Trash? It sounds as though the labels will be removed, but in fact they will be preserved in the trash.

(sorry there is no easy answer here) There is a way to limit your campaigns - both by individual bid amount (per click) and you will be notified when you balance is low so you can make sure your credit card is not charged. Yes: the analytics provided are robust, all keywords are tracked.  You can also filter, sort and analyze a few hours away if you have enough keywords :) Overall, I would suggest finding a free Adwords code.  Try searching on twitter.

What I once thought was a secure password really wasn't all that secure . Today I use 1Password with ""diceword""-style generated passwords. Still offline and for the same reasons, but more secure than my mental algorithm based on the domain name. The only passwords I need to remember any more are the one to log into my computer, and the one that opens my 1Password vault -- both of which are noted in my wife's 1Password vault in case something were to happen to me. Everything else is only a few keystrokes away. Using a hosted password manager means that your passwords are stored somewhere in the cloud, and somewhere nearby to that (in the code that creates/edits/uses them) is explicit instructions on how to decrypt them. Should the site be compromised, it wouldn't be hard to get access to thousands of accounts. For that reason, I'm leery of online password managers. Personally, I use a solution that I made up for myself: I have an algorithm that is simple enough to run in my head, that generates a secure password (upper & lower case characters, numbers, and special characters) based on the domain name and my chosen username. In addition, I try to use oAuth and OpenId wherever possible, so that I have fewer passwords to remember and can be surer that the sites that DO have my password (e.g. Facebook, and my OpenId provider) are properly securing it (salt + hash, etc). If I had to use a password storage utility of some sort, I would probably go with KeePass and store the encrypted file in Dropbox to sync between computers.",2025-11-15T13:20:20.595598Z

From the Google spreadsheets function list : Google Spreadsheets lets you reference
  another workbook in the spreadsheet
  that you're currently editing by using
  the ImportRange function. ImportRange
  lets you pull one or more cell values
  from one spreadsheet into another. To
  create your own ImportRange formulas,
  enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,
  range). For languages where comma is
  used for decimal separation, use a
  semicolon instead of a comma to
  separate arguments in your formula. Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is
  the key value from the spreadsheet
  URL. Range is a STRING representing the
  range of cells you want to import,
  optionally including the sheet name
  (defaults to first sheet). You can
  also use a range name if you prefer. Given that the two arguments are
  STRINGs, you need to enclose them in
  quotes or refer to cells which have
  string values in them. For example: =importrange(""abcd123abcd123"", ""sheet1!A1:C10"") ""abcd123abcd123"" is
  the value in the ""key="" attribute on
  the URL of the target spreadsheet and
  ""sheet1!A1:C10"" is the range which is
  desired to be imported. =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1
  contains sheet1!A1:C10 Note: In order to use ImportRange, you
  need to have been added as a viewer or
  collaborator to the spreadsheet from
  which ImportRange is pulling the data.
  Otherwise, you'll get this error:
  ""#REF! error: The requested
  spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell
  range was not found."" ""key"" is, of course, the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter. I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first, I put a string. In cell A1 of the second, I put =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"",""A1"") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.) (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"";""A1"") ) NOTES: Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 ""cross-workbook reference formulas"" per spreadsheet.

  via our smartphones and whoever is
  doing the shopping always has an

  well as we often stop in to pick up

  what else needs to be bought. We use
  the 'priority' function to separate

  sort through a long list. As an added bonus, if we are shopping
  together we can split up and tackle
  the shopping from different ends of

Do I set up the spam filter on each individual account, or bypass the spam filter on each of these accounts and only enable it on the main account?

I'm not sure if the spam filter is smart enough to also look at the to field for its algorithm. If it was, then I think the obvious choice is to use a single spam filter on the main account. Use a spam filter on the main account only: Pro: There's only one spam box to check for false positives. Con: Might degrade the spam filtering logic since now it's getting a bunch of different types of email messages. Use a spam filter on each individual account: Pro: Might improve spam filtering logic since each email address is going to get a similar mail.

I set up Facebook to email me notifications to Gmail whenever someone sends me a message. The problem is that I have been getting spam messages from people I don't even know. What's interesting is that 100% of these notifications were sent to my spam folder in Gmail. I'm guessing that this happened because these same spammers sent messages to other Gmail users and those users marked the messages as spam. Or it might be because of the content of the messages which looks spammy. Ideally I would prefer not to be bothered with these spam messages in Gmail and only have to deal with them from within Facebook when I log on, so Gmail recognizing them as spam is a good thing. The problem is that I found a false positive. That is, a real friend of mine sent me a message and it appeared in the spam folder. I'm wondering if I should I keep these messages in the spam folder or not. I'm afraid that if I keep them in the spam folder, this will contribute to getting more false positives, since the subject line is very similar ([friend] sent you a message). Is allowing Gmail to filter out some of these messages even a good idea? Shouldn't it just take all the messages from Facebook and present them to me, and it should be Facebook's job to filter the spam? The problem with this last scenario, though, is that I'm also afraid that if I don't mark these messages as spam, I will get spammy content in messages marked as not spam, thus messing up my spam filter even further.

As far as I know, I am not accessing it in another window. Any ideas?",2025-11-15T19:35:26.853547Z
