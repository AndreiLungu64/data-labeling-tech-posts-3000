However, I tried looking at the Outlook (2010) settings and couldn't find how to make a link. So how do I sync my Google Calendar with my Outlook one?"
5,"Can I auto-forward my Gmail to another address?. I'm kind of paranoid about my email and I don't want it to be on Google's servers only. Especially after my account got hacked and all my email got deleted. So I would like to auto-forward my Gmail to another address, but are there any settings I have to enable?"
6,"How do I transfer my blog posts from Google's Blogger to WordPress?. I have a blog on Google's Blogger, but now I want to move to WordPress. Is there an easy way to transfer all my old blog posts from Blogger to WordPress?"
8,"Is Picasa's face tag data stored in the photo itself?. I tagged all my contacts on my Picasa Web Albums, but I was wondering if this data is stored in the photo itself or would I have to retag every picture when I import them to my desktop or share them with someone else?"
9,"How do I search within someone's tweets?. I remember Jeff Atwood ( @codinghorror ) had posted a tweet about a new website, but I can't seem to find the link. Is there any way I can search within someone's tweets to find that link?"

You'll see a message appear in a yellow bar that says: All 100 conversations on this page are selected. Select all 73795 conversations in All Mail Click on the ""Select all conversations"" link on the right side of the message, then click delete. The actual deletion process may take a very, very long time, during which you will be unable to use Gmail or log in (don't worry, it's still churning away in the background, even if it gives you an error!) When it's done, all conversations (except spam) will be in the trash and you should see a message that says ""You don't have any mail! Our servers are feeling unloved."" Now just empty the trash and delete all spam, and your account is now empty."
16,"How do I make Facebook block a friend’s Mafia Wars updates?. I like Facebook to connect with friends, but I don't like the way their favorite games spam me. They just keep giving me Mafia Wars updates! Is there any way to block a friend's Mafia Wars update? Or any other Facebook game for that matter."
18,"Use Google as an OpenID without logging into the rest of it?. Every time I login to Google as my OpenID I stay signed-in. This can get annoying as I feel safer searching Google without being logged-in, even if my dynamic IP is logged. Obviously I can just immediately go to Google and log-out, but as this is a pain, i'm hoping there's a better way. I know that unchecking remember me would stop it persisting across browser sessions, but I don't want to be logged-in when I next go to Google, whether in the same session or not."
21,"How can I upload videos > 15min to YouTube?. I see that some YouTube users have quite lengthy videos. But if I ever try to upload a video of length more than 15 min, YouTube stops me. How can I get more privileges in YouTube?"

26,"You can't without becoming a partner. The upload limit on YouTube videos has been increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes. One of the reasons we can increase the video time limit is that we've made incremental improvements to our Content ID technology that helps content owners manage their videos on YouTube. We look forward to increasing the upload limit as Content ID continues to evolve and become even more sophisticated. If you want to upload videos longer than 15 minutes, try another site such as Vimeo , Blip.tv or Viddler . You could also host it yourself using JWPlayer and a CDN such as CloudFront .  As Even Mien said in the comments, you could also see if you can become a partner."
27,"There are some options: You might want to make your account protected. If you do this, you can control who gets to follow you and who doesn't. However this also means that none of your tweets will be public, so people will have to follow you first (and you will have to accept them) before they can see your tweets. You can block a person you don't like. Just go to their profile and click the block link in the sidebar."
28,"You can protect your tweets if the side effects are acceptable to you. This way you will receive an email anytime someone wants to follow you. On the account screen for the settings page, check the box that says ""Protect my Tweets"", just be aware of the caveats which are as follows (text from the settings page when you are actively protecting your tweets): Your tweets are currently protected; only those you approve will receive your tweets. Your future tweets will not be available publicly. Tweets posted previously may still be publicly visible in some places. I did this recently, it's been much nicer I think."

31,"You can open the game at http://apps.facebook.com/inthemafia/ . Find the ""Block Application"" link and follow the instructions. Further updates from Mafia Wars will not be seen on your account. If you're interested in just blocking a particular user's updates, you can block the person by visiting their profile and doing the same thing on that page, however you will effectively be blocking ALL of their updates and not just their Mafia Wars updates."
32,"You could block them, as described here.  If the account is definitely a spammer, I guess Report JaneDoe as spam would work too."
33,How do I get the phone numbers of my Facebook Friends?. There was a time that somehow Facebook synced to my phone and that was great but I did not want all of them. How can I manually select the Facebook numbers and then export it to my phone via Contacts or Microsoft Exchange ? Where is this option ?

38,"How do I let other people view my photos I’ve uploaded to Photobucket?. I've created an album and uploaded a load of photos to Photobucket, but when I send the link to my friends all they see is a login screen. I've searched but I can't find the option to make the album publicly visible. I don't want to make all the images public, just the ones in one particular album. It would be great if I could limit the viewers to a few people - is this at all possible?"

45,"You may want to take a look at Google's Calendar Sync : Google Calendar Sync allows you to sync events between Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar. You'll be able to determine the direction of information flow, as well as the sync frequency. Staying on top of your Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar events has never been easier! Here's some good information to know to help you get started with Google Calendar Sync. It lists as only being compatible with Outlook 2003 and 2007, so I'm not sure if it works with Outlook 2010."
46,"Is there any way to script a Google Docs spreadsheet?. I have a really complex spreadsheet in Google Docs, and while it works, having the ability to script it a bit (à la VBA in Microsoft Office) would make it a lot cleaner. I heard that this is doable in Google Apps, but I can't find it in Google Docs. Is this possible? Or is this something only Office can do?"
47,"How does the Facebook friend finder operate?. Facebook friend finder is really creepy. It has suggested to me: The father of a friend of mine —whose existence in Facebook was unknown to the said friend of mine himself. The twin brother of a colleague of mine —of whose family I had no idea whatsoever about, Close friends of a school-going young relative of mine —though I had no Gmail or any other web-based contact with the said relative for a long time. An old and longstanding crush of a friend Ex-girlfriend of a friend . Additionally, I have lost count of the number of times when I first saw somebody's profile on Facebook through their twisted suggestion mechanism, and much, much later, came to know who the person actually is. And many more. I have no idea how on earth they find out all this connecting information. I have locked my security settings to the maximum. Nobody can find me on Facebook unless I go to them and add them as a friend. Then how is this possible? How does it work?"
48,"How do I ensure that what I post on Facebook stays private?. On Facebook, how should I adjust my privacy settings so that my posts stay private?"

However, I do have more than 1GB of photos (Picasa) and more than 1GB of files (Google Docs).  Is there any way to use the storage from Gmail in these other services?  Or, to possibly answer my own question, is Google just marketing the available storage of Gmail by banking on the fact that nobody is going to use that much (whereas it would be much easier for people to fill up their Picasa accounts)?"

66,"You can deactivate your account from your account settings page by clicking ""Deactivate my account"" at the bottom. If you wish to use your username or email address with a future account, be sure to change them in your Settings page before you deactivate your account."
67,"Unfortunately, there is currently no reasonable way to use GPG/PGP from within Gmail directly.  The only two options are to encrypt the message manually from a client-side tool, pasting the result into Gmail when you're done, or to use a desktop mail client with GPG integration (such as Thunderbird + Enigmail ) to send messages you need to be encrypted.  Decrypting would likewise entail downloading the message from Google as raw source, running it through the desktop client to decrypt, and reading it there."
69,"How can I export my social graph out of Facebook?. Before I contemplate deleting my Facebook account, I'd like to export my social graph (a.k.a. contacts). What are the steps and/or recommended tools for this?"

72,"YouTube is often slow for me. Is there a solution?. I've heard of many people complaining about the speed that YouTube streams videos lately. Even low quality videos go extremely slow on my system sometimes whereas they seem to be fast in other systems. I do not think that there is any problem with the internet connection I have, as it handles other websites and downloads very well. Are there certain settings I could check to fix this issue or is it a problem with YouTube's distribution servers itself? I am in the United States using Time Warner's Road Runner cable. I access the internet over ethernet through a DD-WRT router (Linksys WRT54G) I use an HP laptop; 1.6GHz Core Duo with 4GB ram on Win XP Pro."

79,"How do I transfer my photos from Flickr to Picasa?. I have been using a Flickr Pro account for a few years, but find it really annoying that I don't maintain a local offline record of my albums and metadata with this. So I've decided to move to Picasa - where I have an offline app to set up, edit and then upload photos and albums. The challenge is that I have around 100 albums in Flickr and want to get them across to Picasa. Do I need to use a Flickr downloader to put them all in a folder and then add them to Picasa? Is there a way I can match the uploaded files with the local files on my computer so I don't end up with a load of duplicates? Can I transfer the metadata (e.g. geolocation) across? If so, how? Hope you can help because my only other method is to do it all manually!"
80,Can I access Gmail through SSL?. Is there a way to access Gmail securely over SSL?
81,I want to receive the tweets of everyone I follow as emails. How do I configure that?. I suspect this might require a 3rd party application.

85,"Gmail now uses https by default. Default https access for Gmail We are currently rolling out default https for everyone. If you've previously set your own https preference from Gmail Settings, nothing will change for your account. If you trust the security of your network and don't want default https turned on for performance reasons, you can turn it off at any time by choosing ""Don't always use https"" from the Settings menu."
87,"An application called Rapportive effectively replaces the ads on the right side with something more useful. (User notes on the contact's email) Not certain of the legalities of this. Also not sure if it is THIS app which is effectively hiding the ads or some setting or feature I have enabled, but this is worth looking at anyway."
88,You could use a RSS-to-email gateway like feedmyinbox on the RSS feed for the twitter timeline in question.
89,"Yes.  Within Settings of Gmail, go to the General tab then scroll down to the Browser Connection setting.  There you can select to use http or https for connections to Gmail"
90,"Yes, just add an ""s"" to the http in the address bar - so to get to Gmail over SSL, type in: https://www.gmail.com You can also change a setting in Gmail to require your account to use SSL : We've recently made the 'Always use https' setting the default behavior in Gmail (the default used to be http). Here's some background: If you sign in to Gmail via a non-secure Internet connection, like a public wireless or non-encrypted network, your Google account may be more vulnerable to hijacking. Non-secure networks make it easier for someone to impersonate you and gain full access to your Google account, including any sensitive data it may contain like bank statements or online log-in credentials. Accordingly, we enable the 'Always use https' option in Gmail by default. HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a secure protocol that provides authenticated and encrypted communication. In your Gmail settings, under the General tab, select ""Always use https"":"

Are there steps I can use to troubleshoot this issue beyond the very basic ""double check that your credentials are correct?"""
93,"Can I change my Gmail email address?. I have a stupidly long email address on Gmail and would like to get it changed, or even just get a new one, but I can't see how. As soon as I log in on Google it knows who I am and signing up for a new email doesn't work. Is there a way to get my email address changed or get a new one that I can then switch to? Edit 2 July 2010: I need to clarify the question because I haven't had an answer to what I want to achieve. I want to change the primary address on my Google account ( https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount ). When I click the link to edit ""Email addresses"", the primary email is shown without an option to switch/change it. When I try add a new Gmail email address, it says ""You cannot associate a Gmail address with your Google Account."" I want the primary email address on my Google account to be a shorter Gmail email address so that I can eventually retire the existing email address."
95,"The Firefox extension AdBlock Plus removes them just fine, although the equivalent in Chrome does not. Regarding what you call ""tracking"", that is just software finding keywords in your emails and displaying appropriate ads. Obviously no personal information is given to advertisers and no-one is reading your emails."

98,"Managing Typepad is extremely easy.  I've used them extensively in the past for our corporate blog, and been fairly happy with their service. The only complaint I've had is that they're somewhat barebones, feature-wise, in exchange for very high uptime and a very simple user interface. As far as I know, Typepad doesn't even offer a host-it-yourself service; that's part of their value: they host it for you.  The advantage over a service that does do self-hosting (such as Blogger) is that you don't need to worry about maintaining your own server, handling bandwidth, and so on.  The downside, obviously, is that you'll pay Typepad rates for hosting media, which are probably a bit higher than what you'd pay for using a shared host."
99,"How can I make my Gmail searches faster?. When I first signed up with Gmail, I was impressed by how fast I could search through my email. Now even simple single-keyword searches can take 5-10 seconds. Perhaps this is related to having over 70,000 conversations archived - but I don't want to delete them if I can avoid it. Are there any tricks to speeding up search time in Gmail?"
100,"If you are using Firefox, you can use Adblock Plus addon to eliminate those ads."
102,"Remove the Chat box from the left pane on Gmail. I don't ever use the chat feature of Gmail. Is there a way to get rid of the chat box on the left side?

107,"Honestly, if you are really concerned with the privacy of your account it may be better to not post anything you would not want to be public."
108,"Alternatives to plus-addressing?. Many email services, including gmail, allow you to create throwaway email addresses by appending a tag of the form +anything after the username component of your email - but many sites reject such addresses as invalid. Are there any services which offer a similar service, but using a schema that's less likely to be rejected? I know about the gmail period-insertion trick, but it's hard to remember what I created the address for with that one."
110,"You can logout of your Gmail account, and then sign up for a new account .  Once you've created an account, go back to your original account and forward everything to the new account ."
113,"Log out and then create a new address.  (Clear cookies if you have to.)  If you want to retain all of your existing email (and anything else linked to that account), I'd recommend setting up the new ""more professional"" address to auto-forward to your existing account .  Then you can simply give people the more professional address and receive email in one place.  You'll also want to change your Reply-To in the ""unwanted"" account so that outgoing emails are ""more professional"" as well: Settings -> Accounts and Import -> Send mail as"

Mint.com uses the same kind of system as Quicken and other financial tools to allow those tools to get your account information.  I would contact your bank to ensure that your account is currently configured to allow that access.  Some banks require you to request it, otherwise, it is disallowed.  Your account may have gotten reset."

118,"Just log out first, then create a new account. After that you can log off again, log in with your old account and in The Settings>Forwarding and Pop/IMAP set it to forward your mail to your new account. As a side benefit, since they are both gmail accounts, when writing a new mail you can choose what address you want to use. That's what I use for my ""formal"" account for jobs applications and so. I log in with my ""casual"" account, send the resumes and stuff with the formal address, and replies will get forward from the formal account to the casual :)"

One way that worked for me was to create an new twitter account with a different email address, and then once that account was active I changed the email address on the account back to the old email address. Useful tip for me."
124,"Update 2012-09-28 : tempalias is no longer running; the source code is available though. If you simply need a disposable address, tempalias provides a very nice service that will give you a disposable address that expires after either a certain number of messages or a certain amount of time has passed. If you care about this kind of thing, tempalias is open-source, so you can grab the source and be somewhat more confident that they themselves aren't going to do anything nefarious with your email address."
125,"You can also configure your current Gmail account to add the new email address. This way you wont lose your contacts etc. There are two steps to this: Create the new account and forward all email to the old address.  In the new account, click the settings button (gear icon in top-right) and go to the ""Forwarding and POP/IMAP"" settings.  Click ""Add a forwarding address"" and add your old email address.  Afterwards, choose the ""Forward a copy of incoming mail to"" and select your old address. Go back to the old account.  Click the settings button and go to the ""Accounts and Import"" tab.  In the ""Send mail as"" section, click ""Add another email address you own"".  Enter your new email address. You can then continue using your old email account.  If you receive any emails at your new address, they will appear in your inbox.  If you reply to them, Gmail should automatically respond from your new address - theoretically nobody would know about your old address."

I am trying to set up a wiki/management system for a software project and keep getting confused by the myriad of options available. I have seen TWiki and Plone before, which bill themselves as enterprise level components. Would they be better to use than something like, say, MediaWiki? What are some other suggestions for wiki/management software?"
132,A couple of options: Follow the (private authenticated) RSS feed of your @replies/mentions: http://twitter.com/statuses/replies.rss - since its authenticated it will require you to sign in and won't work in Google Reader (unless you use Yahoo Pipes as an intermediary ) Use a web-based service (such as http://pu.ly ) to monitor your mentions and email you when they appear
133,"Poor YouTube performance may be due to the following issues : Poor internet connectivity (500Kb/s is recommended). Server load on YouTube, which can be caused by too many simultaneous viewers. Issues with your browser cache. Issue # 1 can be addressed by signing up with an ISP which provides faster internet connectivity. Issue # 3 can be addressed by clearing your browser cache ."
134,"Yes, you can use Adblock Plus to hide these ads if you use Firefox or Chrome. If you just want to stop getting spooked by their relevance to you, you don't have to start wearing tin foil on your head, you can just opt out of Adwords and maybe opt out of Analytics too whilst you're at it :)"
135,"How to remove the left tab on iGoogle. The iGoogle pages now have ""tabs"" on the left side. I only use one tab, ever, so I don't really have any use for them. Is there a way to minimize them so they don't take up a bunch of space?"
136,"Here's an article that describes the process .  Essentially you can use Yahoo Pipes to find replies or mentions within an RSS feed, then provide that feed to the FeedMyInbox service."
138,Mention Notifier is a free service that should do the job: http://software.engraph.com/managementionnotifier/default.aspx
139,"If they're really unwanted, you can add them to your ignore list. You can ignore a specific contact and stop all communication from the contact. You also appear offline to that contact’s Messenger List."

141,"You really can't beat Confluence , especially for $10 (for 10 or fewer users). We use it at my job and it is really fantastic. The organization takes a little getting used to, though."
142,"URL shortening web services/web sites. Does it matter which URL shortening web service you use when shortening URLs? Why will one choose, say TinyUrl over any other?
And is their a lifespan for the shortened URL, will there be a guarantee that it will always be available after it is created?"
143,"I've found the MediaWiki wiki to be very flexible and useful. As a bonus, it's very familiar to anyone who's used Wikipedia."
144,"I like the CODE FORGE kind of applications, like Trac or Redmine, if you have some place to host it. Or Google Code / SourceForge for free hosted options if you don't mind doing your projects open source."
145,"I've noticed what you're describing as well.  At least with some sites, if they provide two-factor authentication , they ask you to verify factors beyond username/password from time-to-time.  Generally, I've been able to resolve this by going to the site manually to verify my additional factors.  Then when I refresh, the information updates again. Two-factor security seems to be more and more prevalent with banking sites.  I know Citibank does it for their student loan website.  Vanguard does it for their site as well.  Chevy Chase Bank (now owned by Capital One) does it on their website too, but I haven't had any update problems on that account with mint.com."
146,"We use DokuWiki Here is a comparison chart between DokuWiki, MediaWiki, TWiki and TracWiki"
147,"I recommend going with the best-known (which personally for me is TinyURL) for the simple fact that people will trust it a little bit more. When I see some of the others out there, I really do hesitate to click."
148,How to forward multiple emails in Gmail. Is it possible to forward multiple emails in Gmail without doing each one individually?
149,"Simply preface a person's name with an @ sign when you type it in a status.  For instance, if you want to tag your friend Joe Someone in your status, begin by typing @Joe .  Facebook will automatically open a drop down where you can select his name."
150,"Even though your security settings are ""locked down"", Facebook still can use your friends list to find other people you may know. Other people may not be able to find you but Facebook can and will still use your information (such as your friend list). They cross reference your list of friends to your friends' friend list to find people you may know. There is probably some kind of complex algorithm behind who exactly they suggest. The algorithm probably checks for multiple friends in common, current location (for distance), similar groups, similar schools, employers, etc."
151,PBWorks provides a bunch of features for collaborating on a project.
152,"Select All Friends in Facebook. How does one select all friends when trying to invite them into groups, etc.?"
153,"If they're all in a single conversation, then yes: click the Forward All link in the top right when viewing the conversation.  Otherwise, no, you cannot bulk-forward random emails. In newer versions of Gmail this has moved to the More button under Forward All , and is only visible when you are viewing a conversation of stacked email (stacked by title replies):"
154,"You should consider PBWiki which has a really great interface, is free for small projects, user-level access controll and more fun features. (Not to mention I've used it myself with great results.) PBWiki Features"
155,Is there a web application that allows you to set up a wiki in 10 minutes?. I've attempted to set up a wiki a couple times but left it go because the complexity overcame the time I had to do it. Is there a web application that allows you to easily set up a free wiki in 10 minutes the same way wordpress.com allows you to set up a free blog in 10 minutes?
156,"Click on the invite button, paste this code in to your address bar: javascript:elms=document.getElementById('friends').getElementsByTagName('li');for(var fid in elms){if(typeof elms[fid] === 'object'){fs.click(elms[fid]);}} and hit enter. All friends will be selected, enjoy!"
157,"This would go against the privacy settings on Facebook. If you need a private communication channel, I suggest you send them a private message with your own address, and ask them to contact you."
158,"I like 37signals's Basecamp software. You get a great, inexpensive hosted solution with a lot of useful features."
159,"A lot of apps have a url shortener built in, which explains why some people use some obscure ones. For instance HootSuite (a Twitter 3rd party app) has a shortener for new posts, and the output is in http://ow.ly format.  Many companies are getting into the game (ie NYTimes) -- perhaps for traffic analysis for their own purposes?"
160,"If you're creating the links and you want to be able to track activity through that link (maybe as part of a marketing campaign), then I'd recommend bit.ly.  If you take any bit.ly link and add a + symbol to the end of it, you can get a bunch of stats about how that link has been shared on Twitter, how many people have clicked through etc I agree with Kyle's point about picking a well known service for trust reasons, bit.ly is the default shortner on Twitter and very well known, so no problems there."
161,"The short answer is, there isn't. This has been recognized as a serious long term issue by many , and as such, an Internet Archive related project called 301 Works has sprung up to address this basically by providing redundancy to each providers records in case one disappears. Personally, I'd stick with bit.ly or tinyurl.com as they are the best and oldest (respectively) out there.  The fact that Twitter currently relies on bit.ly to shorten URLs through Twitter.com speaks volumes."
163,"How do I get a 3D building added to Google Earth / Maps?. I noticed that there wasn't a 3D model available for a particular location on Google Earth. I know how this building looks, so how would I contribute by making a model of it?"
164,"You need to put a contact on your Ignore List first, otherwise they can still see you when you are online and send you a message, because your ID is still on their Messenger list. Here's what to do: Right click on their icon Scroll down to stealth settings Change them to appear permanently offline. Then click on messenger (top left on the messenger window) Click preferences Scroll down to ignore list Click and in the next window add them to your ignore list Click OK Then go back Right click their icon and delete. Note: there is a limit of 100 names that you can put on permanent ignore. Also try: http://nobuddy.zak.2ya.com/ http://www.vizgin.com/remover.php which ""claim"" to remove you from their list. All of this is untested by me.  Good luck!"
165,Wikia is the most common place I've seen to create community wikis on a given topic.
166,"In addition to the two-factor security issue that Scott mentioned, you may need to report the problem to Mint.com's technical team so they can take a look and see what's going on. You can report a problem by clicking ""Get Help"" in the top right corner of the screen (or clicking this link )."
167,Google Sites (http://sites.google.com) lets you set up a free wiki really quickly.  It's a really powerful system with lots of cool features.  We use it for our companies internal wiki and it works really well. The sites you create can be private or public.
168,"I have also noticed that YouTube videos tend to load slowly.  I haven't found a complete workaround, but I have installed an extension that allows me to have YouTube videos start buffering in the background when they are opened so that when I choose to watch them I can do so without them constantly stuttering. The name of this script YouTube Enhancer.  It can be found here . It has many other options for YouTube videos including ""Download Link + Quality Selector + Rollover Preview + Media Controller + Media Resizer."""
173,"How to only send Facebook Updates to friends who play a game?. I've gotten really into this one Facebook Game, some of my friends play it but most of them don't. Before they kill me, is there a way to ONLY publish updates for my friends who play the game? EDIT: I am looking specifically for how to publish updates a specific way. I can tell everyone That they just have to block it, but that is kind of rude if there is an alternative on my end, and not publishing means that the people who do play won't gain as many benefits from interacting with me."

176,"Can I merge two conversation threads in Gmail?. I really like that gmail keeps related email messages in one ""thread"" for easy access. But sometimes an email message gets left out. (I suspect the senders email client is misbehaving.) Is there a way to tell Gmail that I want this email message to belong to an ongoing conversation?"
177,"There isn't a way to search within the site by location.  How about creating a second account, perhaps using a different browser, just for the purposes of searching by your old hometown?  That way you can keep your current account intact."
178,"How can I be certain that a URL-shortened link I click isn't going to send me to a dangerous or unwanted site?. When I see a shortened URL, I'm always hesitant to click it because I don't know where the link is going to go.  (In the worst case, it may lead to an XSS exploit against a site that I'm logged in to) How can I tell where the link is going to go? For example, if I see a link to http://tinyurl.com/3yjnm7y I can go to http://preview.tinyurl.com/3yjnm7y and see where the link is going to send me. How can I do the same for other popular URL shortening services (like bit.ly or goo.gl)?"
179,I like pbworks . Really simple and fast to set up. Some features .
180,"PBwiki is/was exactly what you're looking for. They've rebranded as PBworks and added a host of non-wiki features, but individuals/non-profits can still set up a powerful, functional and free wiki in about 15 seconds. Here's the signup link: https://plans.pbworks.com/signup/basic20"

183,"How do you get Google to retrieve your hacked and deleted emails?. My Gmail account was hacked a while ago, and because the hacker setup a forward that deleted as it worked, I lost a month's worth of emails. Google help (oxymoron) said that I could never get the emails back, but of course we know they keep everything forever. So does anyone know a method to get Google to restore the emails? I'm looking for some customer service trick, or secret email or phone number, or anything. [Yes, I realize since they've admitted that they'll give anything to the Feds that they ask for, I could play that angle, but I'm not looking to go there.]"
184,Search within library?. Is there a way to search only books available in nearby libraries in Google Books?
185,"Jeff Atwood wrote that URL shortening is destroying the web . His argument is that URL shortening distorts PageRank. The internet is the house that
  PageRank built, and it's all
  predicated on hyperlinks. Once you
  start making every link your special
  flavor of ""shortened"" link, framing
  the target content -- heck, maybe
  wrapping it in a few ads for good
  measure -- you've completely turned
  that system on its head."
186,How can I back up all emails stored in my Gmail account?. Can some or all labels be preserved?
187,How do I delete my Gmail account?. I've got an old GMail account I hardly use and want to delete it. What do I need to do?
188,"Check out this page on mail.google.com Click Settings at the top of any Gmail page, and open the Accounts and Import tab. Click Google Account settings. Click Edit next to My products on the right side. Click Remove Gmail permanently."
189,"One option would be to open the link in Google Chrome's incognito mode; even if the link is malicious, it won't have access to your cookies. This isn't foolproof however; the link could be crafted to hide any errors if you're not logged in."
190,"They haven't yet announced anything regarding Google Voice outside of the US Thanks for visiting Google Voice.
  We're not yet open for users outside
  the US, but are planning to expand our
  service to additional countries in the
  future. Though there are rumours that they have been experimenting with integrating Google Voice into Gmail, perhaps as a feature for Chrome OS"
191,"You could use a service like Unshorten Services supported: TinyURL.com, SnipURL.com, NotLong.com, Metamark.net, zURL.ws and many others."
194,There are a number of URL expanders which should work for many of the 'better' URL shortening services out there - such as LongURL . Many shortening providers do not have this preview functionality which you refer to in the question built in which means that these third party expanders are required.
195,"Rather than try to modify the URL to see where it goes (which might not tell you much anyway), open it in another browser (for example Arora is a very simple on) in which you aren't logged-into those sites."
196,"How do I get rid of ""On Behalf Of"" from my sent Gmail messages?. I have a Google Apps account with 1 primary domain and a secondary alias domain (let's say example.co.uk and example.com). When I send emails from the alias domain, the receiving person sees the sender as ""alex@example.co.uk On Behalf Of alex@example.com"", which is a bit messy. How do I get rid of this?"
197,"The most simple way to do this is activating pop3 or IMAP in your ""Mail Settings"" and retrieving the email using your own client (Thunderbird, Outlook, etc.)."
198,"No, there isn't. You can mute a thread, but you can't cleanly merge them. One thing you can do: forward an orphaned email to yourself as a response to the thread you want it to be a part of, then delete the original. That won't force your sender to keep things together, nor is it particularly automated, but for reading/archiving purposes it may fit your needs."
199,"Google Spreadsheets doesn't have Pivot Tables built in.  For any serious data analysis that could be a real deal breaker. However, it does appear that there are apps in the marketplace that add this functionality in, for example: Google Apps Marketplace"

203,"Is there a way I can use my Facebook chat from within Gmail?. I like chatting with people through my Gmail account for a number of reasons, but mostly because these chats are archived and searchable.  Is it possible to use my Facebook chat from within Fmail chat so that I can have the same functionality?"

211,"Is Google Apps good enough for business?. We are looking at using Google Apps for Business for our emails and general ""Outlook"" functions. Are there any pitfalls to look out for, or something great that may have been overlooked? In general it's more a question of, is Google Apps ready to be used by a medium-sized business?"
212,"Get a list of ALL facebook friends and their details. I have used a number of different applications to get what they claim to be a list of all my facebook friends into a .csv file or a similar format.  For some reason, these applications never export all of my friends and the total number of friends listed in the file is always over 100 less than the actual number of friends I have on facebook.  How can I properly export the names of ALL my friends and their details?"
213,"Sure! You can use the HTML5 version of YouTube . All you need is a web browser that supports both the video tag in HTML5 and either the h.264 video codec or the WebM format (with VP8 codec). These include: Firefox (WebM enabled version available here ) Google Chrome (h.264 supported now, WebM enabled version available via Early Release Channel ) Opera (WebM enabled version available here ) Apple Safari (h.264, version 4+) Microsoft Internet Explorer with Google Chrome Frame installed ( Get Google Chrome Frame )"
214,Does Facebook provide an SSL/TLS interface?. Does Facebook only support HTTP or does it have HTTPS also?
215,"To do this, you need to set up Gmail to send emails via an ""external"" mail server. However, since the alias domain is already registered with Google, you can in fact set this ""external"" server to their servers and have it work just fine! Google Workspace Admin -> Apps -> Google Workspace -> Gmail -> End user access -> Enable Allow per-user outbound gateways in Domain admin. Gmail -> Settings -> Accounts -> Edit Info (on alias account) -> Next Step -> Send through example.com SMTP servers (recommended for professional domains)... SMTP Sever: smtp.gmail.com, Port 465 Username: alex@example.co.uk (Note: not the alias domain login, but your main Gmail login) Password: (Password for the above account) Select Always use a secure connections (SSL) when sending mail. If you don't have this other domain added as an alias and are just sending from an additional email address you'll have to send via the email servers of this other domain. (Yes, I know I answered my own question, but it took me an age to figure this out, so I wanted to share it!)"
216,"One way is to log in using a mail client that supports IMAP . You can then export the emails to a backup location, but this is a bit laborious. If you want a continuous backup, you could try something like imapsync . This would require you to run your own backup IMAP server and schedule a regular task to perform the synchronisation. Edit : Preserving labels should work fine, but not quite in the way that Gmail handles them. I've not seen any IMAP or POP3 servers which handle the Gmail label system properly. Gmail presents each tag as a separate folder through IMAP, so as far as the user is concerned, the message exists in several places. (In fact, the inbox is just another label). If you synchronise your account to another IMAP server, you will essentially have multiple copies of the same message."
217,"Web service which allows chat with mathematics formulas. The Google Charts API supports creating good looking formulas based upon LaTeX input: Does someone know an online chat service which makes use of that API to display discussed formulas, maybe with the use of editor such as seen in Knol ?"
218,"Yes - have a look at https://ssl.facebook.com/ , however I do not think it is intended for use. All links from this site will redirect you back to non-SSL. I suppose it's grand if you want to check your live feed securely. As a note: Going to https://www.facebook.com will throw a certificate error, so rather use the above link for access."
220,"Not sure about other services, but another little-known trick that works in Gmail is this: Periods (.) are ignored. That means if your address is joesmith@gmail.com, email sent to all the following would still arrive: joesmith@gmail.com
joe.smith@gmail.com
j.oesmith@gmail.com
joesmit.h@gmail.com Personally, I always insert a period after the first letter when I want to filter out the messages as probable spam. Gmail filters will let you pick those out of the stream by just saying TO: j.oesmith@gmail.com"

It's fast, reliable, good spam filtering, great UI, good calendar and docs integration and best of all it's constantly evolving and getting better.  I love the recent addition of being able to drag and drop attachements to mails and they're adding stuff like that all the time. One feature I know is missing that a lot of Exchange based companies are used to is Public Folders.  I don't believe their is a work around for that one yet - not that I've looked into it too much."

227,"Unfortunately, any app that does this is shutdown because it's against the FB ToS. FB only allows fluff info like profile pic and general location, not the real info like emails and phone #s. This was hotly debated at the beginning of 2008, when Plaxo tried to include this data in Plaxo Pulse. Services like FriendCSV have all been shutdown since then. Edit in response to the questions: automating retrieval / exporting of details of other Facebook users it against the Facebook Terms of Service."
228,"Their customer service is notoriously horrible.  If you get a person on the phone, they will simply direct you to a web page or ask to send in the answer by email. I'll mention gethuman.com but if you call the Google number, they just give you instructions that point you back to the internet. If you want a response, I would suggest filing a claim against them in small claims court.  It won't cost much, and they'll be forced to respond.  IANAL, but you probably have to sue for ""damages"" which in this case would be money, so they could also just pay you and not give you the information you seek.  They could also prove that you did actually 'delete' the info and then the judge might throw it out.  But at least you'd get to an actual human who could help you (or at least tell you they don't have the information). http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-greenspan/why-i-sued-google-and-won_b_172403.html"
229,"I can't speak to a specific limitation but Google Spreadsheets do things differently than MS Excel.  For instance if you need to program in excel you will use VBA.  If you are going to program in Google Spreadsheets you will need to use javascript. I am pretty sure that you will not get to keep your macro's when you import a spreadsheet from Excel into Google Spreadsheets.  If that is an issue for you then you might not want to convert. In general Google Spreadsheets can do a lot of the same things but you may find ease of use things like some of the advanced chart and graph features that exist in Excel either don't exist and must be built, require an app from the marketplace, or are just harder to use. Google is continuously updating their product though so it will get closer. Since Google apps are free, I would spend about a 2 weeks trying out Spreadsheet.  If you haven't run into anything stopping you then you are probably not going to have any issues."

231,"As far as I can tell, this doesn't seem possible via iGoogle's settings. A lot of people did not seem to like this decision when it was rolled out ( google discussion thread ) and has been asked quite a few times in support ( you'll find some suggestions on how to get around this here ). To summarize info that is in that thread, you will need to run some script/extension/addon to remove the tabs which are browser specific of course. For example, If you are using IE7 with add-ons via IE7Pro : Toggle iGoogle Tabs If you are using Firefox: iGoogle Tab Remover If you are using Google Chrome: iGoogle tab remover for Chrome Other browsers? Not too sure of but other people can probably add to the list."

236,"I have personally worked for 3 businesses which relied on Google Apps for Business for their email and calendar infrastructure. Although there were a few outages, the worst of which lasted around 36 hours, I would HIGHLY recommend Google Apps if your organization fits the following profile: Small company (>50 employees). Don't already have Exchange infrastructure. The majority of employees are comfortable with the GMail interface (threaded messages, labels). Don't want to spend the money or time setting and supporting an Exchange email solution."

You can then select one of these lists to view only new stories and status updates from people in those lists."
238,Yes it is. In settings->Accounts and Import->Import mail and contacts you can import all contacts and received mail from a pop3 or webmail account. In settings->Accounts and Import->Add Pop3 email account you can make gmail to check an account regularly for a mail and get it.

242,"Advantages of Facebook groups vs. Facebook pages?. I would like to get a good comparison of current features of Facebook groups vs. Facebook pages. To the best of my knowledge, the only advantage of using a Facebook group is that until you reach 5000 members, you can mass massage all of them (something that goes away starting from your 5001 member). Is there any other advantage of Facebook groups (over pages) that I don't know about?"
243,"No, this is currently not possible.  Google allows you to additionally sign on to AOL instant messenger, but not Facebook chat. However, you can use a 3rd party app [Trillian for example] or web-based chat sites that integrate with both Gtalk and Facebook chat."

308,"Direct messages, commonly referred to as simply DMs , are one of the only parts of Twitter that are private. Introduction Basically, direct messages are messages you send directly to another Twitter user ; no one else can read them , except for the recipient. However, the user you send a DM to has to follow you on Twitter . This requirement was enacted to decrease the amount of spam on Twitter. Sending a direct message There's a few ways to send a direct message: You can send one from the main What's Happening? textbox in the Twitter web interface. To do this, you type: d username message or dm username message : username is the name of the user you're sending the DM to, and message is your message. You can DM someone by going to their profile page and selecting Direct Message from the Actions button (next to the Lists button). You can hover over a user's profile picture in the timeline/inbox and select Direct Message from the Actions button. You can go to the Direct Messages tab on the Twitter home page (after you log in) and select a user. Once you do so, you can write a message as usual and click Send . Difference from @ replies In your question, you also asked how direct messages are different from posting @username ... on Twitter. The @username style is known as an @ reply . You can use it to reply to someone's tweet or just say something to them (not to a specific tweet). They are quite different from DMs: The user you @ reply to does NOT have to follow you . @ replies are NOT private . They are visible to everyone, unless your tweets are protected (private).

387,"While I'm impressed that your organization would rather use Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor, I'm afraid that Google sites does not currently support Markdown syntax.  You could write the text in Markdown locally using an editor like Textmate, and use a bundle or a script to convert that to HTML, and then paste the HTML into your site (Google Sites will let you add raw HTML to your sites -- inside certain form elements) but that feels like overkill."
388,"How to allow Google Calendar users to subscribe to my website's calendar (event data) and have GCal show updates automatically. I have a website that stores and displays data about events.  I'd like to make that data available to Google Calendar users and allow them to subscribe to my site's event data.  The event data can and does change occasionally, so having user's import an iCal file to their own Google Calendar is not ideal. Is this possible? Can I keep all of the data on my site, via a URL, and allow Google Calendar users to subscribe? Do I need to put my event data ""into Google"" somehow, and then allow Google Calendar users to subscribe to that data?  If so, I'll need to keep  event data on my site and the data ""in google"" in sync, correct?"
389,"How can I follow my Facebook Friends on Twitter?. When I log into Facebook in the News Feed it shows some of my friends posting via Twitter. Is there a way I can automatically follow them on my Twitter account or get all their twitter ids to follow ?

390,"You might want to try Delicious . They do have a firefox plugin that allows you to sync automatically between the website and your browser if you wish. And you can save your bookmarks in delicious rather than the browser bookmarks if you prefer. They have tools for importing/exporting bookmarks from your browser when you first set up. Plus you have the added advantage of being able to access your bookmarks even if you are not on your personal machine(s). Delicious does allow you to keep your bookmarks private if you wish. The only downside is that you will be organizing bookmarks by Tag rather than directory as you would normally, but personally I found I got used to that pretty quickly."

395,If your labels are applied based on some basic rules you could apply some filters to automatically label mail appropriately and use one of googles suggested methods to import mail from your old gmail account
396,"Yes!  You can do this in Google reader, but I don't think you can set up as a permanent search. If you have a group of feeds you want to search through, bundle them together under a single folder/tag. Like group all your tech news feeds you read into ""Webtards."" Then you can use the search box at the top of Reader to search for a keyword, and filter it to just the feeds in your tag/label.  So you can search for ""Twitter"" in your group of feeds ""Webtards"" to see everything your webtards are saying about Twitter. Reader also gives you the ability to search within an individual feed, which is also helpful.  So if you subscribe to the TechCrunch feed, you can search for ""Twitter"" within the feed ""TechCrunch"" and get back a bunch of articles from MG Siegler, God bless him."
397,Saving a Gmail attachment to Google Docs. Is there a way to save an email attachment in Gmail to Google Docs?
401,"If you get an email with a Word (.doc), Powerpoint or PDF attachment then there are two links next to it, 'View' and 'Download'. When you click on 'View' the document is opened by Google Docs and there is a link at the top to allow you to 'Save in Google Docs' Excel attachments give you three options, 'View at HTML' ,'Open as a Google spreadsheet' and 'Download'."
402,"I don't think so, however, you could go into settings and use the custom view to see if any of them are suitable.  For example, you can choose to show 2, 3 or 4 weeks instead of a month.  Keep an eye on their 'Labs' tab in settings as they put experimental features in there (such as year-view)."
403,"Not directly. But some file formats (most notably PDFs), you can view online by clicking the ""View"" link next to the attachment. When you are then viewing the file, there is a link to save it to Google Docs."
405,"In gmail, you can configure it to retrieve email from another account via pop. Go to settings, Accounts & Import, and add the details under the ""Check Mail using Pop3"".  It will automatically label retrieved mail with the name of the account, or you can set up a custom label if you prefer."
406,"The one I probably use the most is Show Anchors , which I made. It shows an anchor icon next to every element on the page that can be linked to directly. Sounds stupid, but it's very useful when you want to refer someone to a specific section of a website. And it's much easier than trying to figure out where the site owner put their anchor links (if they even did in the first place)."
407,"Security of browser only password managers. There are password managers like KeePass which store all the passwords in an encrypted container on the local machine. I would have to copy this container over to other machines to be able to have my passwords there as well. Then there are password managers which are essentially like KeePass but store the password container online. And then there are algorithmic password generators which, based on a master password, create the password for the currently visited website on the fly. Examples for such online password managers are SupergenPass and PWDHash . All I need to carry around with me is a tiny bookmarklet (which gets synced across browsers) and the master password in my head. What are the advantages or drawbacks, security-wise, when using the online password managers of the 3rd category? Is there an online password manager which addresses these drawbacks while providing the advantages?"

411,"How can I backup my wordpress.com hosted blog?. I have a blog hosted on wordpress.com, and I'd like to back it up. How can I do that?"
412,"You can do the following: Caution : do this at your own risk. If you accidentally press delete while in the trash, your messages will be gone forever . Clear your trash on your old account. Trash all your messages in your old account. Untrash a single label. Import the messages to your new account using the POP3 feature (Get mail from other accounts). Tag all these new messages with the same label you used on your old account. In your old account, trash the messages that were imported successfully. Repeat steps 2-5 for each label. Untrash your messages. This will probably only help you if you use labels as folders (i.e. one label per message). Otherwise your POP3 client will have already read messages from before and it gets messy. If you don't mind messages having the exact same tags, then it's fine. Update: I just tried it, and this should work. The reason it works is that when you put messages in the trash, two things happen: The labels are preserved. POP3 clients will not see the messages. Note: When you trash the messages from the All mail folder, the following misleading message will be shown: Moving conversations from All Mail to
  the Trash will remove them from all
  views, including labels and search
  results. This is because in Gmail, a
  conversation can be displayed in a
  variety of views, but there is only
  one copy. Are you sure you want to
  move the only copy to the Trash? It sounds as though the labels will be removed, but in fact they will be preserved in the trash. It's just letting you know that when you click on one of the labels on the left, you will no longer see the message since it is in the trash."
413,What are the differences between Office Web Apps and Google Docs?. It's unclear to me what the difference is between Microsoft's Office Web Apps and Google Docs. Are they at all similar - or is it just marketing hype from Microsoft. How would I decide which to use for sharing documents online with friends and coworkers?
415,"One great option is http://www.tweepsect.com/ In addition to showing you people that don't follow you back, it also has an easy way to follow or unfollow people directly from its interface. The downside is that it requires you to log in, whereas friendorfollow.com does not."

419,"Facebook ""share link"" feature feature for Blogger, Google Buzz, or other Blogs?. Facebook has a nice share feature to share links. When I share a link on Facebook, I paste a URL into the status box (The box which says ""What's on your mind?""). Facebook will automatically populate my post with a some interesting text from the article and an image thumbnail from the article. I like this, because it saves me time and provides an interesting image to the viewers. For example, if I paste http://flowingdata.com/2010/06/10/context-to-underwater-depths into the status box on Facebook, the application will know this is a URL, grab some text from the article, and create a thumbnail of the image. I can often choose between multiple thumbnails. If I then hit the 'Share' button, the text and thumbnail will be posted as an entry to my profile. Is there a similar feature which I can use for my blog hosted on Blogger? I've tried several different methods to replicate this feature. I'm trying to post to my blog on Blogger or on Google Buzz using Google's ""BlogThis!"" bookmarklet, and Google Toolbar 'Share' button. However, these tools just prepopulate the post with a simple hyperlink. There is no image thumbnail, no relevant text from the article, etc."

They have a good list of features from HTML 5 and examples on how to use them. Plus resources and information about the latest news from HTML5."
422,"One of the largest differences is that you get much better compatibility with Microsoft Office when you are using Office Web Apps instead of Google Docs.  Google Docs can butcher a good bit of your formatting when importing and there isn't a good way to get it back if you need to export. That said, I think Google Docs has much better real time collaboration and sharing features than Office Web Apps does."
425,"There are probably 5 most talked about features Web workers - allows developers to run scripts in background work so a web application can do more than one thing at a time. Video tag - An easy way to do flash free video online, we just need a standard codec Canvas - Exactly what it sounds like, a way to create an image on the fly within the browser window Application Caches - Allows applications to store stuff so that you can use them later without being connected to the internet (Read your email later after it gets downloaded, Like Google Gears was) Geolocation - Ability for the browser to relay it's location to the application Many of these features have already been implemented in some browsers and applications.  Google latitude uses geo location, Google gears was a plug-in based implementation of the same ideas as application caches, Canvas like things have been done with JavaScript. Web workers is new and can allow for a bunch of different things to happen inside web applications.  Any kind of side processing that seems to work now, will be more smooth as a single thread can be dedicated to notifications or an in-site chat or other periodic processing task within the application.

426,"They're actually very similar.  Both allow you to create, modify, and share several document types online.  The biggest difference between the two is in the feature set.  While Google Docs is a great way to create basic documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, Office is far more powerful when it comes to styling the presentation of these documents.  So if your focus is on content, there's not much of a difference.  If your goal is on producing a production-ready document collaboratively, I'd recommend Office. One other advantage of Office Web Apps over Google Docs is the inclusion of OneNote.  There's no equivalent feature in Google Docs."
428,"For files that you can't open directly in Docs, but want to save there, you can save it to your local machine, and then use the ""Upload ..."" button on the front page of Docs. There is a 1 GB limit for documents saved, but not converted to GD format."

437,"I personally like the hosted manager a bit better as long as the security is implemented properly.  Take LastPass for example (my favorite), they don't store an un-hashed version of your master password so without deliberately cracking your passwords, even the site host can't access your information.  This is of course only as good as your trust in the third party which is where the security concerns come into play.  Long story short, as long as they don't keep an un-hashed copy of your password, I don't mind using the hosted password managers."
438,"A Google engineering team started an internal 'organization' dedicated to this called the Data Liberation Front .

483,"You asked a lot of questions, I will do my best to answer each one: Adwords is worth the money if you can quantify your entire costs (including obviously the campaign) and the value of the new customer.  This may seem easy at first, but there are likely to be several factors in determining these values. (sorry there is no easy answer here) There is a way to limit your campaigns - both by individual bid amount (per click) and you will be notified when you balance is low so you can make sure your credit card is not charged. Yes: the analytics provided are robust, all keywords are tracked.  You can also filter, sort and analyze a few hours away if you have enough keywords :) Overall, I would suggest finding a free Adwords code.  Try searching on twitter.  You can generally get about $100 to try it out -- by then you should be pretty comfortable with the system and how to bid effectively (i.e. do not pay suggested price!) Good Luck"

526,"2018 update I've learned much in the 8 years since I originally wrote this answer. What I once thought was a secure password really wasn't all that secure . Today I use 1Password with ""diceword""-style generated passwords. Still offline and for the same reasons, but more secure than my mental algorithm based on the domain name. The only passwords I need to remember any more are the one to log into my computer, and the one that opens my 1Password vault -- both of which are noted in my wife's 1Password vault in case something were to happen to me. Everything else is only a few keystrokes away. Using a hosted password manager means that your passwords are stored somewhere in the cloud, and somewhere nearby to that (in the code that creates/edits/uses them) is explicit instructions on how to decrypt them. Should the site be compromised, it wouldn't be hard to get access to thousands of accounts. For that reason, I'm leery of online password managers. Personally, I use a solution that I made up for myself: I have an algorithm that is simple enough to run in my head, that generates a secure password (upper & lower case characters, numbers, and special characters) based on the domain name and my chosen username. In addition, I try to use oAuth and OpenId wherever possible, so that I have fewer passwords to remember and can be surer that the sites that DO have my password (e.g. Facebook, and my OpenId provider) are properly securing it (salt + hash, etc). If I had to use a password storage utility of some sort, I would probably go with KeePass and store the encrypted file in Dropbox to sync between computers."

534,"Having every single Foursquare checkin post to twitter has become quite a faux pas, at least among my followers. Some even consider a single tweet (i.e. took over as mayor) to be an automatic-unfollow catalyst. Depends on your audience though, I guess. One option would be to use the Selective Twitter app for Facebook, which only uses tweets that include the ""#fb"" hashtag to update your facebook status. By using this, you could have Foursquare update both facebook and twitter without the tweet again updating facebook; and then for normal tweets that you want to push into facebook, include ""#fb"". It costs you a few characters, but it accomplishes your goal."

541,"Well, they are all implemented differently some are more secure and some less. For example, I use Clipperz . The way Clipperz works is it encrypts/decrypts an encrypted blob that the server stores in javascript . This means that if your blob finds its way to an evil hacker they will not be able to decrypt it (if you decided on a reasonable password) The code for it is open source, something that fills me with a bit more confidence cause I can audit it. LastPass uses the same approach so it is fairly safe. I would be less likely to use stuff like https://www.pwdhash.com/ cause it means that if I want to change my master password I will need to change it on all sites. Also, it is less secure as if people know the rules I use to build the password they can brute force my master password."

In their FAQ they mention that you can have your account suspended for 24 hours if you pass some upload threshold. However, no specific numbers were listed. Via Gspace's FAQ 5. My Gmail account was locked for 24 hours. What should I do? A. Wait for 24 hours :) . This happens if large amounts of data is uploaded or downloaded in a single day. So, try to avoid that.

The problem is that most of these(for me at least) are at 100% so are not very useful.

How do I mark an item as 'not new' so that the stats provide an accurate view of my feed reading habits?

There are various things that govern the process. The two most obvious that spring to mind are: Incoming links - the more sites that link to yours mean that yours is seen as a more authoritative site and so is ranked highly. Content - if the content of the site matches the title (and to a lesser extent keywords in the HTML) then it's seen as a ""good"" site. This content is both the body text and the headings used on the page. Sites used to add common search terms to their keywords in an effort to ""fool"" Google into ranking their site highly. Google now pretty much ignore keywords, but it's still worth adding relevant ones."

So, for instance, you might combine the tags ""hitter"", ""pitcher"", and ""fielder"" into a bundle and call it ""Baseball"". It doesn't change anything about the existing tags, but does allow you to create another level of heirarchy. When looking at your bookmarks, del.icio.us will show this bundle and all the tags grouped under it as a separate section. The experimental tag bundles are a great way to simulate folders in del.icio.us. To take things a step further, You can keeps all of your tags lowercase, but capitalizes the first letter of the tag bundles, making it even easier to keep track of and organize your bookmarks in bundles. ( from here ) Update I was asked in the comments: how the grouping works? If I search for pitcher will I get all of the links tagged Baseball? My answer: No, it won't be shown in search (or the search filter). It is simply a way to bundle all your tags in the right navigation bar. I played with it (I think two years ago). never found it to be worth the time in retrospect (because eventually, you just search all your bookmarks) I don't think there is more to know :)"

Most users have adapted to it, although there are a few huge issues: Moving existing mail into Google Apps is a very slow process. Imported mail also tended to confuse users.  Most of our users got a clean inbox and we setup Outlook with PSTs. Many users are confused by threaded conversations and often times accidentally forward information they didn't want to send. Outlook can be used with Google Apps domains but it is not recommended. Don't use it unless it's essential for the user. Offline Mail works well, but it causes a lot of time consuming support issues. Don't use it unless it's essential for the user. Google Docs will not replace the desktop application. If you have multiple separate Google Apps domains there is no Global Address List between the domains. You will need to use a 3rd Party tool or work with the Google Apps API. Limited centralized & tiered Administration: You are either an Admin or a user. Insert 3rd party tool if necessary. List of limitations . I'd recommend that if you have executives that live and die with Outlook you should consider keeping some users on Exchange."

For example ""stackoverflow.com is great"" would yield different results from stackoverflow.com is great You can search specific sites for information by using: site:yoursitehere.com searchterms This works to the point where you can narrow your site search down to specific sub-folders, by using: site:yoursitehere.com/folder1/folder2/ searchterms.

I don't think there is much point in displaying to your users what type of HTML is made to build the page and that it's valid. Most users wont know the difference anyways. But the sites that actually does the validation can is a good tool for a developer. It's a quick way to check if you have made any mistakes in your markup and can avoid browser rendering the site differently.
792,"What you're after may be a little difficult. However, if you use Firefox there are a couple of things I do to protect myself from pages I haven't been before. Firstly, I use the NoScript add-on for Firefox. It keeps Javascript from running on sites that you don't explicitly allow. Second, I just came across this a few days ago, HTTPS Everywhere switches you to the HTTPS version of several sites which will offer you greater security. In addition to that, you can add as many rule sets as you want so that any site you come across and want to use the HTTPS version (has to be available of course) you can. Hope this helps."

797,"Suggesting some non-technical points you might want to consider in addition to the safety measures mentioned by others. They do require you to use the site to some degree so you'll have to be prepared to view portions of the site, so if you're really worried you might want to take precautions first (no script, disabling cookies etc.). There's a Contact Us page that lists a physical address and phone number for the company. All links point to where they claim to point to - check the URL in the status bar is what you expect it to be. They let you look round the site before signing up. While you can't expect access to all content, you should be able to view some - low-resolution images, the first paragraphs of articles etc. Any costs are clearly set out before you sign up. There's a no-cost option that allows access to some content. The site shouldn't ask you to install anything on your computer. While I wouldn't expect all of these to be always present (apart from the contact us page) - after all each site is different - I would expect some content for free."

Built in public/private/sharing stuff too so some sites can be public facing while others are internal (by Google Apps ID) only."
800,"dhulk's answer has some good info, but I think those are secondary. Let's start with some basics: Is it running on https ? Look in your address bar. If the URL starts with https, then traffic to and from this app is encrypted. Just because it's running on https doesn't guarantee that it's secure. The company (or person) who built the site has full access to any information that you send in. Examine the certificate Double-click on the lock icon to see certification information (the position of the lock varies from browser to browser). Look at whom the certificate is issued to. If the name of the company doesn't seem familiar, do some google searches to figure out what the relationship is between the certificate holder and the service. Look for a privacy policy. This should specify what they do with the information you give them. It doesn't guarantee that they'll obey their stated policy, of course. Research its reputation. Do some google and twitter searches. Try things like ""don't trust X"" or ""security of X"" (where X is the service) All in all, you're looking for a consistent picture that suggests that the operators of the site are up front and trustworthy. It's still no guarantee, but it's a great start before you divulge personal information."

913,"IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want. From the Google spreadsheets function list : Google Spreadsheets lets you reference
  another workbook in the spreadsheet
  that you're currently editing by using
  the ImportRange function. ImportRange
  lets you pull one or more cell values
  from one spreadsheet into another. To
  create your own ImportRange formulas,
  enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,
  range). For languages where comma is
  used for decimal separation, use a
  semicolon instead of a comma to
  separate arguments in your formula. Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is
  the key value from the spreadsheet
  URL. Range is a STRING representing the
  range of cells you want to import,
  optionally including the sheet name
  (defaults to first sheet). You can
  also use a range name if you prefer. Given that the two arguments are
  STRINGs, you need to enclose them in
  quotes or refer to cells which have
  string values in them. For example: =importrange(""abcd123abcd123"", ""sheet1!A1:C10"") ""abcd123abcd123"" is
  the value in the ""key="" attribute on
  the URL of the target spreadsheet and
  ""sheet1!A1:C10"" is the range which is
  desired to be imported. =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1
  contains sheet1!A1:C10 Note: In order to use ImportRange, you
  need to have been added as a viewer or
  collaborator to the spreadsheet from
  which ImportRange is pulling the data.
  Otherwise, you'll get this error:
  ""#REF! error: The requested
  spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell
  range was not found."" ""key"" is, of course, the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter. I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first, I put a string. In cell A1 of the second, I put =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"",""A1"") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.) (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"";""A1"") ) NOTES: Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 ""cross-workbook reference formulas"" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer ) The ""new"" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 ""cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra ) In the ""new"" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern )"

I'm wondering if there is any way to share (at least some of) the contacts between everyone in this domain. Similar to how you can share your Calendar with people in the same domain. I know about enabling Contact sharing, but it seems like that will only share the contact information of people in the same domain. I'm looking for an easy way to share the hundred or so non-domain contacts. Now that it has ActiveSync/Exchange support, are there any workarounds available at least?"
957,"One solution would be to setup Gmail to read your email using POP3 and filtering the messages in Gmail. An additional benefit you get from this method is that it will login on your behalf so that your hotmail account won't become deactivated due to you not logging on. To configure Gmail, use these instructions . This is the configuration for Hotmail: Incoming Server: pop3.live.com Incoming Port: 995 SSL Encryption: yes Outgoing Server: smtp.live.com Outgoing port: 25 (use port 587 if the default port is not working) Authentication: yes TLS Or SSL: yes"

From there you can select any address you'd like to forward to. This solution has two caveats: The mail is deleted from your hotmail account after being forwarded. You must log into your account once every 270 days or else it will be deactivated.  (Considering the fact that you use other services through Windows Live, this should not be a problem.)"

I've recently looked at installing a wiki engine, in order to provide - as with most wikis - a user-editable repository of information. I've looked at three specific engines: DokuWiki TikiWiki MediaWiki My users' preference tends towards MediaWiki (presumably due to familiarity and some semblance of brand awareness), which is fine with me. The downside of this wiki engine is that its administrative/configuration options seem to be ... dated. A colleague described it as php and pray , which seems a fair assessment. So I'm left wondering: is there a plug-in, or another resource, that allows for a simple dashboard-style configuration editor (à la WordPress, for example)?"

I work as a Google Apps re-seller, and this has been one of the largest pain points for customers so far.  For what its worth, its also one of the most requested things to address for Google Apps suggestions.  Hopefully they are working on it. In short, your best bet is to use a tool or program to import your existing shared contacts into the domain shared contacts list.  It's worth noting that even after you do this, users should be able to search these contacts from their own contacts list, they show up in search results and a note is displayed that the result came from the global list when a contact is selected."

Third option is to try to reduce the size of the file, which is a much broader topic. Sometimes this is impossible as files like .jpg and .gif are already compressed. You can reduce the quality of the image in some way , but this usually isn't worth the time unless you are using the photos on a professional website.

Basically I want the main content of the page to not include the word ""iPhone"", or even if it does, to not be the main focus of the content. Update: Here's an example you can try it out on: If you use the search query ""from the clever ad campaigns"" , you will get the result Motorola Droid accessories - CNET Reviews . Now if you add -iphone to the query, the result will no longer appear. You will notice that the linked page has the word ""iPhone"" mentioned only once on the page and its not even in the main article's text (it's on the bottom in the Popular topics section).

1308,"When using Gmail with multiple accounts, should each account have a spam filter?. I currently have Gmail set up to read mail from several different accounts, most of them are other Gmail accounts. I'm wondering what the best way to set up the spam filters for these accounts is. Do I set up the spam filter on each individual account, or bypass the spam filter on each of these accounts and only enable it on the main account? It's my understanding that Gmail uses (at least something similar to) Bayesian filtering, where it will learn from the messages you mark as spam. My email accounts are set up so that they get a similar email. So for example, I have a personal account, a work account, and one that I use to signup for services. I'm not sure if the spam filter is smart enough to also look at the to field for its algorithm. If it was, then I think the obvious choice is to use a single spam filter on the main account. Use a spam filter on the main account only: Pro: There's only one spam box to check for false positives. Con: Might degrade the spam filtering logic since now it's getting a bunch of different types of email messages. Use a spam filter on each individual account: Pro: Might improve spam filtering logic since each email address is going to get a similar mail. Con: If someone tells me they sent me a message and I don't see it, I have to log in to that account and manually check the spam filter. Which method would you recommend?

1380,"Is it a good idea to mark Facebook spam notifications as spam in Gmail?. I set up Facebook to email me notifications to Gmail whenever someone sends me a message. The problem is that I have been getting spam messages from people I don't even know. What's interesting is that 100% of these notifications were sent to my spam folder in Gmail. I'm guessing that this happened because these same spammers sent messages to other Gmail users and those users marked the messages as spam. Or it might be because of the content of the messages which looks spammy. Ideally I would prefer not to be bothered with these spam messages in Gmail and only have to deal with them from within Facebook when I log on, so Gmail recognizing them as spam is a good thing. The problem is that I found a false positive. That is, a real friend of mine sent me a message and it appeared in the spam folder. I'm wondering if I should I keep these messages in the spam folder or not. I'm afraid that if I keep them in the spam folder, this will contribute to getting more false positives, since the subject line is very similar ([friend] sent you a message). Is allowing Gmail to filter out some of these messages even a good idea? Shouldn't it just take all the messages from Facebook and present them to me, and it should be Facebook's job to filter the spam? The problem with this last scenario, though, is that I'm also afraid that if I don't mark these messages as spam, I will get spammy content in messages marked as not spam, thus messing up my spam filter even further. What do you think? Side note: I've tried marking messages from Facebook as spam, but it didn't help reducing the amount of spam I get at all."

It is very tedious to find attachments you know are there when the icon shows up in neither the search results nor the threaded view."
1414,"There's no easy way to fix this. Here's what I did: Go to Settings ... Filters . Click on Create a New Filter . Select Has Attachment . Click on Next Step . Click on Apply the label , and select New Label from the drop-down. Type in the new label in the dialog box that pops up. Click Create Filter , and apply it to all conversations in the inbox. Here's the downside: Any email with images in it will trigger this because by definition they are attachments. The good news is it will also get messages where the attachment was further down and not in the most recent thread of the conversation."

However, in both cases it moves the message to the inbox rather than archiving it, forcing me to have to manually find this email and archive it.

If you really want all these things in one calendar, I think the only way to do it is by creating your own then copying the ones from the main holidays calendar across.
