1,Should I include a career objective on my resume?. These usually are overly vague and don't add much. Are there circumstance when these are worthwhile?
2,"How do I take a vacation when I'm wearing too many hats?. I've been at my current job for a little over two years, during which I've not taken a vacation or used much of my paid time off. I know that if I do, odds are I'll end up getting phone calls or emails for important issues that only I am able to resolve. I'm unfortunately involved in most operations and IT matters to some degree, as it's a small company. Of course, a common suggestion is to find another job, but that's neither desired nor realistic. How can I manage to get away from the office for awhile in a situation like this? Edit : We now have another IT employee with whom I've been focusing on knowledge transfer, so there's redundancy on a majority of daily tasks. Taking a vacation in a week where I can reasonably expect few interruptions."
3,"The problem with CV objectives isn't just that they can be too vague; they can also be too specific. Objectives tend to either be so broad as to be useless, or so specific that you're shoehorning yourself out of the job. It's for these reasons that objectives are usually frowned upon.  There may be an odd edge case though where they actually add value."
4,"The problem I have with ""Objective"" is it talks about what you want.  Well, as a hiring manager, given that you're a complete stranger, I don't care what you want - I want what I want! The flip side is that it at least gives me some insight into whether or not you'd be a good match for the position I have to offer."
5,"How could I maintain a flex agreement when my boss moves on?. When I hired with the company I'm with right now, I negotiated a flex agreement, saying that every other Friday I'd have off. I have the email in which that was agreed to, and everybody's been happy with the agreement. On Thursday, however, the boss with whom I negotiated that arrangement was let go. Because I've done a really good job, the old boss' supervisor would like to promote me to my old boss' slot. One problem, he says, however is that he's a little concerned about how I seem to be working from home ""a lot."" Upon hearing of the arrangement, he now ""understands,"" but isn't sure if he can promote me under the current arrangement.  What would be the best way to try to keep this flexible arrangement but still get promoted?"
6,"Is it better to invest energy in curating an online resume (LinkedIn, StackOverflow Careers) or a Word document?. Not that you can't do both, but which has the bigger bang for the buck?  Will there come a time when we don't send resumes around, just hyperlinks to online profiles such as LinkedIn?"
7,"I had the same issues as you.  I started with a small startup where I was the only person who was incharge of the servers/code/development and so on.  I was headed to Mexico for a trip and of course would not be available.  What I did which worked for our company was I found someone who could handle things with the server in case anything went down.  This person was ""hired"" as a emergency person while I was out. I would suggest talking to the company and let them know that you need to take a vacation before getting burnt out of work and suggest that you bring in someone for a temporary emergency contact that can handle things like this. Doing this would also give your company a point of backup in case something would happen to you.  This way there is not one point of failure for something like this"
8,"If there is absolutely no back up for you, arrange to be contactable at certain times during the holiday or even certain times each day. Answer the phone then and only then - if necessary take two phones/sim cards so you can make and receive personal calls/texts outside these times. This will give you the break you need and your employer the comfort they need that you are still available for support. I would guess that most problems won't be so urgent that they can't wait until the next ""contact time"". A better alternative is to train a few people within the organisation to do parts of your job. This way you spread the load and also, more importantly, the knowledge."
9,Cross training is critical.  You can get buy-in from your boss by explaining how he currently has a single point of failure in the systems you support.
10,"Is loyalty (depth) or diverse experience (breadth) more important to a hiring manager?. From a long-term goal setting and ""hireability"" perspective, is it more valuable to have gained significant experience in one company or to have a diverse portfolio of companies and hats on your resume? Basically, should I be constantly on the move to different companies to gain a breadth of knowledge or focus on one company for depth in a specific methodology (not necessarily one specific skill, just one way of doing a specific hat)?"
12,"The only time that I included an objective was when I was looking for internships and co-ops. The university that I went to had requirements for co-ops, which could either be 3 months or 6 months in duration. I included an objective on my resume to make it obvious that I had met my requirements for starting a co-op, the start quarter I was interested in, the duration I wanted, and what aspects I was most interested in. When I was applying for full-time positions, I removed it. It became too difficult to concisely describe what I was looking for in a meaningful manner. What I was looking for in a job is something that we can discuss when talking at some kind of job fair, a phone screen, or even an interview. At this point, I used my resume to highlight my education, experience, and other qualifications and everything else would come out later."
13,"Most businesses have an off season, so take your vacation then. Ask to be contacted by e-mail, and only your boss can call you for actual emergencies (or a single person who has the capacity to judge if it truly is an emergency (server meltdown) or, as would very often happen, not one (lost files, lost e-mails, etc). Take your e-mails every other day, announce that's how you will work."
14,"Basically, should I be constantly on the move to different companies NO. The idea of moving around a lot to get some diverse experience may sound like a good idea, but I've personally seen at least one candidate get rejected for the explicit reason that he hadn't stayed at one job for more than a year. Ideally, try to find a good job that'll give you a good breadth of technical experience.  If the job turns out to be a stinker, then by all means move on.  Just don't think you'll ever be doing yourself a favor by frequently moving from job to job."
15,"Remember that in a work-at-home situation, the onus is on you to demonstrate value.  One technique that some of my co-workers use is to send an email at the beginning of the day, describing their plan for the day, and at the end of the day, outlining what they accomplished. Err on the side of overcommunicating when you're working at home.  Give them no reason at all to be suspicious."
16,You should take care of both variants; the LinkedIn profile matters for many recruiters. I think the on-line profiles will be more powerful in the future than the actual CVs are. Also having a website to show off your awesome work is a very big plus as more and more new companies are interested in this kind of way to evaluate candidates. Some of them will recruit this way only :)
17,"The big problem I see is that your career goal doesn't match with what the prospective employer wants - especially if you want to be CEO of your own company within 5 years (say). There's a lot of things unsaid when recruiting. The employer wants someone to ""just do the job"". What you want is career progression, training and a paycheck at the end of each month."
18,"When should I bring up pay rate when scouting a job opportunity?. When looking for job opportunities, when should one pop the question about approximate salary? I don't want to waste their time and mine by going through a whole process and finding out we don't agree on salary, but I've noticed a great deal of companies don't offer up salary figures. When should I ask what the approximate salary is for a position I'm interested in? In the screening call? Do I have to wait for an interview?"
19,"It's tough, but there are several things to consider. Often we think no one else can do what we do. If this is actually the case, then you (and the organization you work for) are in a bad place. What if you quit? What if you were injured/sick/long-term disabled? In the vast majority of cases, things aren't as serious as we might think. In order to get out from under the ""I can't leave because I have too many things to do"" problem, you have to systematically train others to either take over additional work, or at the very least train a backup person/team who can manage things in your absence. Even if it just starts with a long weekend vacation (where the worst thing that can happen is only what's possible in 24 hours), you need to build redundancy under you. Identify why you can't leave. What is it about your role that makes it so difficult for you to go anywhere? Is it because you literally hold the key to some lock box that cannot be accessed without you being there? Is it because key decisions can't be made without your approval? Is it because you're an expert at some key part of your job/office management that  no one else is qualified or trained to handle? All of these situations have solutions: give someone else you trust the key while you're gone, give someone temporary decision-making power, train people around you to handle what comes up and give them your cell number in case something blows up. Lastly, just try taking a vacation. You'll find a mix of things that come up, some of which aren't actually emergencies, some of which are. You need to get comfortable with the following things: taking the occasional phone call on vacation, trusting people to handle it (and not letting them get away with just calling you and dumping it on you), and not leaving your cell phone on all the time. Let things roll to voicemail, and check it only once every couple of hours or so. You'll probably need to work up to the point where you can do this comfortably, but most people find that they've either made insufficient plans for their absence, or they don't trust people around them, or a combination of both."
20,"They both have their strengths, and both are necessary. Your LinkedIn Profile can be a general overview of your career, while your resume can be tailored to specific experience relevant to a position.  Your LinkedIn Profile also shows off recommendations as well as other interests that you may have, while a resume wouldn't."
21,What is the best course of action when someone is performing sub-par in your team?. I have been in a couple situations where a member of our group pulls a lot less weight than the rest of us. Usually the manager doesn't realize. However after seeing people like that get credit for something they really did quite little to merit it. It is hard not to act on it. Should you approach the person first (is it possible they don't know they are not doing anything)? Would it be considered childish to tell a manager you do not think the person is performing at par with the team?
22,"Less than a year at a job is a Bad Thing if it happens more than once or twice.  On the other hand, doing what I've done and staying at one place for 9 years is also sub-optimum for a lot of companies. No hiring function in the US places any value on 'loyalty' any more. But really, it's your life, and life is very short.  If you are happy in a position then you should stay until there is a good reason to leave.  If you are unhappy, life is too short to stay just because some hypothetical person in the future might wonder why you didn't stay longer. Don't let the next job tail wag the dog of the job you are in."
23,"I think it's becoming much more prevalent that recruiters are starting to rely on online profiles - they're starting to realize that the second you send over a Word document to them, it starts to get stale and 6 months to a year down the road, it's good for historical reference, but might not be relevant to current postings."
24,"I don't want to waste their time and mine by going through a whole process and finding out we don't agree on salary I don't think there's any way around it.  Some jobs will give a salary range in the description, and some won't.  But virtually all of them will be offended by you wanting to talk salary before they've even decided on whether to hire you. It's inefficient, but it's just the way it is."
25,"Will there come a time when we don't send resumes around, just hyperlinks to online profiles such as LinkedIn? This is hard to say, and I think depends on your type of work. For those whose job type involves a lot of online, searchable portfolios, having an online presence is far more impressive. Resumés are, after all, mostly formulaic with a list of achievements that don't highlight your individual skillset. Allowing an employer to see your work and as such review how you do the job before you get there will go an awfully long way to getting employed. That said, some, indeed many types of job, do not have such portfolios. I still think online networking is important for many types of career, but I wonder if simply providing a link will work. Smaller companies with less IT literate staff, including directors, for example, might well not be able to parse that. In addition, I always think it looks bad to just say ""hello, here's my url"". As such, I've personally mixed the two approaches - a paper (well, PDF) CV which acts as a traditional CV but also prominently links my online profiles."
26,"Unfortunately you have to wait until the end, until they're really ready to hire you.  They might not be willing to disclose the salary until you get through the process (since you might well be starting at a higher rate than people who already work there)."
27,"How do I ask my boss to pay for an expense?. I'm possibly going to get an internship at a company this summer, and since its a unpaid internship, I have no real way of paying for a bus pass to get to work every day. Is there a way to politely bring up the subject?"
28,"I find that the online profiles are (1) more and more commonly used, and (2) are way more flexible and more likely to be up-to-date. From a functional standpoint, recruiters and potential employers want to get a profile of you, and what you've worked on. Keeping the online version up-to-date (and making sure that it's publicly accessible, so recruiters won't have any trouble accessing it). I spend zero time keeping my paper-based resume up-to-date. If someone needs a physical copy of it (e.g. for an interview), I will create one for them at the time the interview is going to happen, and not before. I've completely moved to managing my experience, portfolio, and work experience online."
29,"Does my geographic location matter when requesting a salary?. I currently work in a state where my salary is quite comfortable and the Cost of Living Index is quite low. However, if I move to another state, especially anywhere Silicon Valley, I'll need about twice the pay to have the same comfort level. Are hiring managers respectful and knowledgeable of this situation, or do they equate making $40K in the Midwest US with being worth that much everywhere else?"
30,"The answer is ""it depends"". It will probably be a red flag to a hiring manager if you have lots of short term jobs (unless the nature of your industry means that short term contracts are the norm). The last thing they want to do is have to train your replacement in 6 months time. However, it might also be a red flag if you've stayed in one job for 10+ years (say). They might think that you don't show any drive or desire to ""get on"" and that might be just what they are looking for. Having had several jobs will widen your experience which is a good thing."
31,"Bear in mind that the manager may well know exactly what's going on.  Just because you don't see what's happening doesn't mean nothing is happening. What I'm saying is that just because the person wasn't fired yesterday doesn't mean your boss doesn't know what's going on. Maybe the guy is on a Performance Improvement Plan. Maybe they're trying to ease him out or into another position. But don't assume that because you can't see action, nothing is happening Does your review process not include getting feedback from peers? If everyone shares your opinion, this will come out.  It just might take longer than you'd like."
32,"This depends a lot on how you normally find work. I obtain most of my work (both full time and consulting) through referrals. Referrals eliminate the need to keep up a LinkedIn or SO Careers portfolio. Because they tend to be local I also get face time along with good support from whomever made the introduction. Do you like dealing with recruiters? You'll probably love LinkedIn. Non-stop hammer on the inbox for anyone who actually has a skill set listed on their profile page. In short, having a LinkedIn or other online resume / portfolio can't hurt you, but it's something that you should keep up-to-date if you rely on it for any work."
33,"Most objectives are just HR babble-speak 'dynamic fast-paced exciting blah blah blah'. On the other hand, if I am looking for  a C++/Boost developer, and I see a resume that says ""Objective: A position as a C++/Boost developer"" that's very interesting to me. So if you have a specific type of job in mind and really aren't interested in much else, then put your specific objectives on the resume. If you don't have real specific ideas about what kind of job you want next, just leave off the objective."
34,"How do I maintain a work-life balance when company culture tends towards frequent overtime?. I usually don't mind working overtime (no additional compensation) because I enjoy my work. However, it does eventually grate on me. I've enjoyed a minimum of overtime in the past few months but know it's going to be picking up again soon. When everyone else works over without complaint, how can I decline to without looking like I'm slacking?"
35,"That's pretty typical for managerial or supervisor positions.  It's not as big of a deal for normal developers or even lead positions, but once there's an HR component involved (you do reviews, hiring / firing decisions, etc), you're going to lose a lot of flexibility from your schedule (outside of normal PTO type situations).  At least, that's the status quo I've seen in the market over the past decade or so."
36,"The best thing to do is just ask.  If there are other interns there ask around and see if anyone else has the same issue of needing to get a bus pass from the company.  If there are no others that you can find, ask to meet with the boss in an informal meeting and just bring up that you wanted to know if there were any ways for the company to help you out by getting a bus pass.  Just be careful about doing this and make sure that having transportation was not part of the requirements for the job. Also if you do get a ""no"" from them.  Drop the question completely. pushing for something like this after a no was already given could create tension between you and your boss and if the internship has a chance of being turned into a full time job, it could put a negative mark on your notes."
37,"Getting a high-quality new hire in a competitive hiring environment. I am on a small software development team in a fairly small company. We are in a larger metro area (about three million people), but nowhere near Silicon Valley. I am not in charge of the search, though my boss (who is) clearly listens to my input. We have a full-time vacancy, and we are having difficulty filling it. In this metro area, most developer hiring appears to be through recruiting firms. However, none of the firms we have engaged have brought us the right candidate, and in general they are bringing us too few candidates anyway. We have considered using Stack Overflow Careers , but right now, there are too few active profiles in our area to justify the (admittedly modest) expenditure. I have asked my ""social network"" without success. I am very interested in getting this position filled by someone who will do a good job because, frankly, we're swamped. What else can I do to help get someone good for this position?"
38,"Make it painfully clear to any hiring manager that the 40K you make is in a very low cost-of-living area.  To really drive the point home possibly mention the rent you pay. Or better yet, don't mention you're current salary at all; it shouldn't be relevant.  The hiring manager should be asking you what target salary you're looking for, and that should be that. Regardless though, if they're working in Silicon Valley, then they should certainly know that salaries are going to be higher than they are in the Midwest."
39,"Can I pursue romantic relations with a client if our project is completed?. A friend of mine works as a management consultant. On a previous project she was working closely with a Fortune 500 client's team. One of the team members and her had chemistry, but they maintained professional standards and didn't act on their feelings for the duration of the project. The project wrapped up, and she was assigned to a new project with a different work group, in a different industry. Is it unprofessional and/or unethical for her to pursue this relationship at this time? Would it prove problematic given that the other person was technically a former client?"
40,"The promotion is a new role with new terms and conditions. You need to discuss with your new boss whether it's practicable for you to be out of the office every other Friday. You can't assume that your current arrangement will carry over. If you don't take the promotion you should be able to keep the current arrangement - your contract hasn't changed just because your boss has, and you have it in writing. Well assuming that your company treats e-mails as equivalent to letters and someone else (preferably in HR) was copied into the e-mail."
41,"In my experience, hiring managers are acutely aware of this.  When recruiting from out of state, hiring managers and recruiters in an expensive area will be prepared for this topic to come up. Worth Essentially, ""worth"" is defined by the success or failure of their previous recruiting efforts: If a business can get good employees in your field from your area for $40K, then they'd probably still consider your worth to be similar, no matter what you think. If a business has only had success getting employees to move from your area to theirs at a minimum of $60K, then your worth is probably more like that. In the end, the maximum worth is going to be what they can get similar-level employees for in their own area (or else they wouldn't be looking). Specifically speaking, hiring managers in Silicon Valley know it's expensive to live there and salaries are, on average, higher than many other areas to account for it. Your responsibility That being said, the recruiter is not going to just give away money that they don't feel they need to, as with any negotiation. They will be prepared to have the discussion — if you say you currently make $40K in a cheaper area, they'll be prepared to hear that you need a significant ""cost of living increase"" — but you must be prepared to ask and hold up your end of the negotation with real numbers. You should know your relative worth in your area Are you on the low, middle, or high-end of the pay scale? If you are considering a new job, can you justify moving up the ladder in addition to a cost-of-living increase? Some areas pay more (relative to that area's broader average salary) for certain jobs due to demand.  Are you in high-demand or low-demand in your area? You should have a good idea of the relative cost of living of the new area You can find out relative salary differences by searching for your job title in the Bay Area on glassdoor.com or on a salary comparison tool like indeed.com - Silicon Valley vs. Nebraska (Nebraska is for example of ""Midwest""). It's still a negotiation For your own sake, you should be in the drivers seat of any salary negotiation discussions. You should be aware of the cost-of-living differences, the demand for your position in the new area, and you should be prepared to cite numbers and justify them when asked (and potentially without being asked, to avoid wasting their time or yours)."
42,"How far out are you going in your search?  You might try increasing your range to up to 50 miles (or further, depending on how far you're currently looking).  Depending on how the traffic and commuting situation is in your area you can draw people from further away.  At my workplace we've got employees coming in from up to two hours away (120 miles)."
43,"How can I tell which job requirements matter in software offerings?. Tech job offerings are plagued with over reaching and unrealistic job/experience requirements. They want college grads to have 5 years of experience, list multiple extremely specific technologies they use which no one would have as a normal skill set, or require deep experience with emerging technologies. These requirements sound like someone rattled off the software/skills of a previous employee with no concept of what was important about those skills. For example, when asking for 10 years of Oracle SQL experience what they probably really need is someone with deep SQL knowledge and experience using databases in an enterprise setting. I always see these specific requirements on the job offer but once I get down to it I find most companies want skills, not technical knowledge in a specific brand of technology, language, etc. How can I figure out what they really need when I'm interviewing/being screened? How can I probe without making it look like I'm unqualified, communicating that I have what they really need, just not the exact flavor of expertise on the offer?"
44,"This also gets to a matter involving negotiations. If your position is changing, often the expectations will change with it, even if the supervisor wasn't also changing. Also, engage the supervision in a discussion about why he was initially concerned about when you work at home. Dig deep, ask questions, and don't be defensive in case the answers you start to get back aren't what you want/expect. You'll often find that these kinds of things come down to various ways that people approach work, and how they approach supervision of others. To some extent, this will come down to the new supervisor's management style, and there may not be a ton that you can do about it - this may be the ""new way"" that things will operate. On the other hand, you might find that your questions lead to the underlying issues (the supervisor doesn't know how to measure productivity/effort unless they can physically see you, or maybe they feel communication is more effective in person, etc.) which will tell you what you'll need to do in order to satisfy the underlying concerns and potential fears. Clearly, if you've done a good job, and are in the running for this promotion, then you're capable. With any negotiation, you're spending a certain amount of political capital (whether or not you actively engage in politics) on trying to get what you want, so just be aware of that. Maybe the tradeoff is worth it, maybe it isn't."
47,"How best to indicate that I've been the ""go-to person"" on a resume. For the past 7 years or so, wherever I work, I end up becoming ""the guy everyone goes to ask technical and programming questions"". Because of that, I'm always ""promoted"" (sometimes formally, sometimes informally) to technical lead. How would you describe that trait in a resume? How would you describe this succinctly, and without sounding pretentious or snob? Is that even something you should put in your resume?
BTW, here are the terms I though of: Internal Technical Consultant Internal Tech Guru (that's kind of snob, actually) Main point of contact for technical questions (does that even achieve what I'm trying to tell the reader?)"
48,"Usually, you can get at least a yes or no from the hiring manager (or internal recruiter) as to whether the salary is going to be in the range you're envisioning.  Make sure that you give a range (and pad it a bit) to make sure that the position you're interviewing for will pay what you're looking for. As an alternative, you might consider asking what the salary range is of the position that you're interviewing for.  That'll at least give you an idea where your desired salary falls, so you know how much mobility you'll have in that position.  That may prompt other questions about how long before promotions, merit / COLA raises, etc."
50,"What is a resume / CV? A resume, or CV, is a written summary of your:
 - education
 - work experience
 - credentials
 - accomplishments A resume / CV is used to apply for jobs. What questions should have this tag? This tag applies to questions about: writing resumes and CV's what skills and experience to demonstrate on a CV or resume how to best present ones skill set on a CV or resume suggested 'best practices' for writing CV's or resumes"
51,Questions relating to resumes and curriculum vitae (CV).
52,"Can I trust employers that make the first move?. I've had several companies make offers to me based on my resume and online presence. At first glance, they're a very mixed bag; some very exciting offers from good looking companies and some that feel like lame cold calls. When I am contacted by an employer unsolicited, should I assume they are likely cold-calling a large range of people? For obvious reasons I only want to continue the conversation with employers actually interested in me and my skills. How can I tell when an unsolicited offer is backed by real interest instead of blind reaching?"
53,"This tag applies to questions about phone screenings, interviews, entry tests, background checks or other situations of this ilk. It also applies to questions about the paperwork and other agreements between employee and employer during the hiring-process."
54,Questions relating to the employment process for a new employee.
55,"Salary is fixed cash compensation paid to an employee in exchange for work, and is frequently the largest component of total compensation. It is a distinct and separate form of compensation from wages, bonuses, equity, and benefits. The salary offered by an employer, or demanded by an employee, is affected by a number of contributing considerations: Other forms of compensation offered or demanded in addition to salary Availability of individuals capable and willing to perform the needed work Quantity of employers seeking individuals for similar work Any risks, hardships, or safety concerns associated with completing the work Reputation of the employer and employee Policies of the employer Local regulations Issues relevant to salary Almost all employers, and many employees, will encounter questions about salary compensation. Relevant discussions on The Workplace include: Negotiating an initial salary, either as employer or employee, for a new job Negotiating, or making the decision to negotiate, increases to salary at a current job Comparing alternatives to salary compensation Discussing programs or policies that seek to make salaries transparent or secret within an organization Understanding and discussing employer policies that seek to level salaries across the organization You should consider using a different tag if your question is about: Bonuses (use bonus ) Equity compensation (use equity ) Benefits like health insurance or paid vacation (use benefits ) Other forms of compensation like hourly wages or piece wages (use compensation ) Related tags compensation benefits bonus equity leave vacation Outside resources U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - The BLS makes detailed employment information, including salary statistics, available online Glassdoor , Indeed , LinkedIn Salary - These online tools allow you to look up and compare salary information of many companies"
56,"For questions about fixed monetary compensation, distinct from hourly wages, piece wages, bonuses, and non-cash compensation."
57,"How can I find a better work-life balance in an internet company which is ""always on""?. As a community manager for a large internet company, I find myself often working what most would consider too many hours a day. Indeed, several of my friends have linked me to videos such as this one , and others have encouraged me to find a better work-life balance. However, I have trouble pulling myself away from my work. For one, I enjoy what I do. For another, our site is 24/7/365, meaning our users don't stop using our sites. In fact, a former executive at our company told me this rather directly, though in reference to a different situation. I've taken some steps, such as creating barriers for myself. I do not log onto the sites from some of my personal devices, such as my tablet computer, or my personal laptop. I also don't take my work laptop home during the week. I worry that this isn't enough, and that my friends are finding my increasingly unable to do fun things....and are finding me boring -- I feel like I probably talk/complain about work too much. I ask because I feel, to a degree, the demands of my position are starting to affect my personal life. How can I find a better work-life balance? Am I on the right track by setting up barriers for myself? How can my employer help me find this balance?"
58,"I actually picked up some absolutely amazing contract work from a cold-call.  The individual came across my Stack Overflow profile, saw I had the skills necessary, and the rest is history. And of course there's plenty of spammers out there.  If the email seems legit, then by all means reply."
59,"I've used ""resident expert"" for this very purpose, along with some responsibility language along the lines of ""consulted with colleagues on an as-needed basis."" To make this really sing, include an accomplishment line that points to results that came from the company having you in this role, e.g. ""Avoided hundreds of bugs in the design phase by providing guidance to colleagues who were working on [...]""."
60,"The first thing that came to my mind was Technical Consultant.  Adding Guru to a resume in my opinion would make me toss out a resume pretty quick.  Makes me think the person may be full of himself and a ""i know everything"" kind of person"
61,"Why not just use Technical Lead?  If it's not a real promotion, just put it in quotes.  Specify that you've acted as the technical resource for the team in your job duties description section."
62,"Ideally you aren't revealing your current salary to hiring managers anyway, but if you have to, then furthermore you should probably be seeking to work for companies who aren't going to bust your salary down as a result of where you live, especially if you are intending to move to work on location. A good employer is not going to lower your salary because of where you come from. They might use your previous salary as a reference frame... and of course you may feel compelled to point out to them what the cost of living index is, etc. I don't work in the valley, but I have to assume that they realize that the valley is $texas compared to many other places."
63,"Part of the answer depends on who the audience of question-askers is: People who are junior to you or subordinates?  ""Mentor"" People who are your peers?  ""Team Lead"" or ""Technical Lead."" People who are running your group, division or company?  ""Senior leader,"" ""Advisor,"" or ""Architect."" And by all means, fortify your reputation as the ""go-to guy"" by pointing to a significant StackOverflow rep (but explain what SO is)."
64,"I like the term ""consultant"", and you can embellish it how you like. ""Guy who is the only one who actually knows what they are doing"" will always sound crass, sadly."
66,"From your description I would say this person is a Leader or Expert in your area. You're a Problem Solver and a Consultant. You'll have to pick a term that meshes well with your area of expertise and your manner of selling yourself. Pick something that sounds authoritative, but not self-inflated. Guru sounds like you're trying too hard, as do many of the ""fun"" titles like ""Ninja"" I've been hearing fly around. I also immediately suspect Neckbeardism when I hear Guru."
67,"It depends on what you do. If you're startup hopping it might not matter so much. Managerial folk, lead developers, and such, people who have serious responsibilities in companies, it may look better for them to stick around longer. If you can rationalize your job history, long or short, then that is the key."
68,"In my experiences, the job posting will list the things that someone hired to the position is likely to come into contact with. Having more experience in those particular areas or with those specific things is, of course, beneficial, but doesn't mean that the candidate who gets the job has all of those skills. When I come across a job posting, I break it down in two ways. First, I identify which of my skills directly lined up with the skills in the job posting. Then, I identify which skills were easily transferrable or relatable to the skills requested in the job posting. When I'm communicating with the company, I make sure to touch on both of these - highlighting past experiences that are directly relevant, but also related technology and emphasized times when I've had to apply knowledge to learn something new."
69,"Wow - lots of great answers... putting a few things together, I'd offer: Determine the expectations of the new position before signing on.  Any promotion is a change in expectations, but the most profound is usually the one from individual contributor to manager.  At that point, you become much more a representative of the organization and its values than you were before, and that is bound to come with expectation changes.  A big question is - does the organization espouse a work-from-home tolerant philosophy?  By creating a supervisor with this work-agreement, they are saying to everyone else ""this is OK"", and the boss may or may not be ready to do that. Find win conditions to staying at home - for example is it possible that you can move all your ""sit alone and think"" work to your day at home, which may allow you to minimize disruptions - often I have suceeded at diverging from my boss' ""norm"" by highlighting how he's getting more bang for the buck from me doing things differently. Be sure that even at home your communication channels are open - if you are hard to reach or perceived as unresponsive, there will be more pushback, as a supervisor must be both easy to reach and responsive. Be aware and engaged in talking through the bosses perceptions of how others in the team may react.  The boss may not be worried about you , per se, but another person on your team.  In which case, you and he may be able to talk through these team issues and find resolutions that don't involve you giving up your work/life balance."
70,"I got my current position at a great company from a ""cold call"".  I had submitted my resume to them ~3 years ago when looking for work and got a call about 6 months ago based on that.  I think as with most things... it depends.  You still need to do the research on a company, regardless of who reached out to whom."
71,"Is it unprofessional and/or unethical for her to pursue this relationship? Would it prove problematic given that the other person was technically a former client? I believe it depends on two factors: Whether there is a likelihood of that client being accepted for new work again. The industry you are in. To explain - whilst on the project, the two individuals will have had equal access to any discussed intellectual property and sensitive material. If that's the only project undertaking, then I cannot see an issue. However, it gets technical if for example the company deals in intellectual property belonging to multiple partners and there is a likelihood of the customer being signed up again. In this case, the relationship could be construed as inside information - and discussing work at home might potentially give away other companies' intellectual property. If you're having trouble visualising that, let's take an example. Fred works for a big airline, IFly. He really likes Jill, who works for GoodEngines. IFly contract GoodEngines to make some engines, they do, all done, Fred and Jill start dating and so on. Then, IFly want some more engines making. GreatEngines submit some IP as part of their bid. Fred reviews the bid, but has a stressful day and goes home ranting to Jill about it. Over chicken fajitas, to which he's partial, he accidentally lets slip that GreatEngines are using SuperFuel to Jill. Whoops. Usually, this sort of thing can be managed as with any conflict of interest. I would suggest the following action be taken: What does your contract say about it? Ultimately, it may be a breach of your T&Cs of employment to even engage in the relationship. What do management/HR say about it? I am not suggesting asking permission - however, assuming you are not barred from having said relationship, covering your bases by raising a potential conflict of interest would be a legitimate thing to talk to HR about. Of course, this assumes a specific problematic scenario with which I have some experience (not necessarily romantic experience, however). Clearly, if it's just a paper order from your local stationary supplier, that's a bit different!"
72,"Don't dismiss it out of hand - dig in to each one.  If you just ask the question, ""What about my profile made you think we were a good fit?"" the spammers won't have have the time or energy to respond and you can start filtering right there."
73,"There's no substitute for asking the right questions of any potential employer, regardless of who initiates contact. I don't think it's a matter of trust - it's a matter of feeling them out and making sure it's a good fit, regardless. I don't think there's anything inherently untrustworthy about it. Maybe your skills are in high demand. Maybe they are calling lots of people - the fit is what should matter."
75,Questions relating to particular abilities or expertise.
76,"I know that this may not be immediately useful to you in your current search, but Manager Tools strongly recommends maintaining a ""bench"" of people you know whom you may want to hire in the future and informally learning whatever relevant you can about them ahead of time. Then, when you have an opening, you can go right to the people on your bench who you think are particularly relevant. That you already have a relationship with them will make them much more likely to seriously consider applying."
77,"Proceed, but with caution.  Be discreet for a few months, since it may come to naught.  But if your friend sees a future with this person after 3-6 months, she should make a disclosure to her HR department.  It's a formality, but an important one, since both people might be asked have to waive certain rights to sue."
78,"You need to find things that replace the satisfaction and stimulation you get from whatever you are doing at work. From my point of view, as someone who used to spend a lot of weekends programming, it was mostly because I didn't have anything else I liked doing more than I enjoyed programming... and as a result I would burn myself out severely on it, and yes, even become unbearable to other people. If doing your work is highest on your activity chart then I think it could suggest that you need to keep hunting for other activities until you find one that really strikes a chord with you. And it sounds like that might be something you haven't tried yet. I would recommend something that involves being inconvenient to an electrical socket or cell phone tower."
79,"A good balance is one that involves you Leaving Work Problems at Work and Personal Problems at Home as much as possible per the agreed upon terms of employment. I am single handedly responsible for 24/7 x 365 uptime on multiple web applications where I work so clearly this is not possible all the time, but the general rule of thumb for me is that if: It cannot wait until tomorrow System outage that requires your immediate intervention Required of you to address from home immediately per the terms of your employment. then it is something you should do from home.  Otherwise put your laptop away and go out to dinner with friends!"
81,"Across two companies in two sectors of the marketplace (defense/finance) we've used the term Subject Matter Expert for this.  It gets used so much (in the US, or at least the NorthEast part of the US) we even call it ""SME"" (pronounced 'smee""), although for clarity I'd skip the acronym on a resume. I've put that on my own resume, and seen it on others.  It distingushes from ""Technical Lead"" for me in the following ways: Technical Lead - may or may not be the expert on all aspects of the project or the work of the team that reports to him.  More likely, he knows some depth about some things and less about others, but has outstanding leadership skills so he can rally the team, and match work and people to the best effect. Subject Matter Expert - high level individual contributor, who is the go-to guy on certain key technical areas.  Can be either in the solution domain or the problem domain.  Has strong teaching/mentoring capabilities, but may not be doing managerial/leadership stuff.  In fact, the purest of SMEs may be people you do not WANT to task with team leadership, because then they don't have as much time as they should have to keep abreast of the state of the art and mentor people through the really hard questions. When I hear lead, I suspect the person has to skim the surface of at least a few technical areas.  When I hear SME, I feel sure the person has made a deep dive. In particular, annotate it with areas.  For example, I call myself a Subject Matter Expert on Java Web Security and PKI.  I would be relunctant to believe a resume that didn't put some reasonable qualifications down - for example, all fo JEE is pretty broad, more likely a SME is well-versed in particular APIs."
82,"Is it unprofessional to pursue personal relationships with site users?. As a community manager for a large internet company, I interact with our users (and moderators!) on a fairly consistent basis. In fact, I often spend large swaths of my day in the main moderator chatroom, handling moderator issues and contributing to the conversation that is going on. Moderators are unpaid users who cultivate and police a site. (By contrast, I am an official employee of the company, and I receive a salary.) Also, from certain perspectives, I'm a moderator or user's first line of appeal, meaning that if an issue requires escalation, I'm one of a group of people they turn to first. I've been fortunate enough to be able to meet some of these moderators and users in Real Life. I find I get along well with some of them, and enjoy spending time with them. Is it unprofessional for me to pursue friendships and personal relationships with these users?"
83,"Selecting interview attire for a technical job interview. According to the book ""Programming Interviews Exposed"": In general, though, a suit is overkill for a technical job interview.
  A standard technical interviewing outfit for men consists of nondenim
  cotton pants, a collared shirt, and loafers (no sneakers or sandals).
  Unless the job you're interviewing for has a significant business or
  consulting aspect whereby formal dress will be required, you generally
  don't need to wear a jacket or a tie. Women can dress similarly to
  men. There are a few ways of finding out the appropriate attire for an interview.  You can ask a friend that knows the place, or if there is a 3rd-party recruiter you're talking to, I wouldn't feel shy in asking them about this area of interview prep. If you don't have a friend, or 3rd party recruiter, is there another way that you could ask directly without coming off weird? Please include the exact language you would use in the question. To me, I would rather ""play it safe"" and be over-dressed at a casual office, than be under-dressed at a conservative office.  Is it better just to play it safe? On the other hand I read in ""The Google Resume"" (emphasis mine): '[Tech companies] pride themselves on their funky and innovative
  culture, and they want people who will fit into this . ""You have to
  prove why you are there, and that you know you fit within their
  community, that you enjoy the lifestyle,"" said Andre, a (successful)
  Apple candidate. ""The moment my interviewer said, 'We are very
  informal' I took off my tie.""' Based on some of the answers below, it's better to play it safe and go with a suit.  Should we be conservative in the kind of suit as well?  In the market you could find a navy stripe suit, modern fit, light colors, etc.  Is it better to play it safe in this regard as well, and not choose a funky color or a light-colored suit?"
84,Being that they are unpaid I would guess no. Your employer is a vendor of a service and the people in question are voluntary consumers who engage at their leisure with nothing at stake but their own time. It doesn't seem like a conflict of interest in a business sense.
86,"As long as you don't let it affect your work then no, it's not unprofessional. Obviously it could be seen as being unprofessional, but as long as everyone - including your employer - is happy then you should be OK. In fact, it could be argued that forming a personal relationship with these users is part of your job as community liaison. You are part of the conduit between the regular users and moderators and the company. Your job would be much harder if you didn't get on with them at some level."
87,"Without more details it's hard to say whether the person could be unaware that they're under-performing, but in my experience it is always better to bring a problem to a person directly and give them a chance to fix it themselves than to go over their head right away. Is there some objective way to measure the amount of work everyone on the team is doing, say a number of [x discrete products] completed per week? If so, I would suggest approaching them as non-confrontationally as possible, noting that their production is significantly behind other members of the team--using concrete numbers rather than a blanket 'you don't work enough'--and asking if there's something you/the other team members could do to help get them up to snuff. It's possible they need more training or aren't aware that they're that many orders of magnitude behind everyone else and just need to put in a bit more effort. That said, if the person isn't receptive to constructive criticism and is genuinely a drag on the rest of the group, there's nothing childish about making sure that's known. Just make sure everything is above-board, that when you bring this to your boss you keep your criticism as a professional and not personal issue, and that the person in question has had ample chance to rectify their behavior first."
88,"There are probably many good (and possibly correct) answers for this, but I'll suggest an answer in one particular area — productivity . Why I have found that I am able to ""disconnect"" from work while at home when I feel that I've been very productive during the day. Productivity is not just about whether you worked hard or not — you are obviously working very hard.  It's also about feeling that you accomplished all the right things. I believe that the inability to disconnect comes from the friction of feeling like something is not done, or needs attention.  You will feel stress until you find a way to reduce that friction. How A system like Getting Things Done would help this.  There are other similar systems that center around one principle: Make sure every input you have is accounted for so that you reduce all friction when you need to work ( and free up your brain to relax when you aren't working!) In short, any time an input comes in (something you have to do), write it down in an ""inbox""  Keep a master list of all the projects you have going, and review them regularly to make sure it's all there.  At the beginning of a day, go through all of the things that need doing and pick the ones you can do.  Then, do them. In order to help you disconnect, make it a habit to clear your inboxes at the end of the day: Never leave email inboxes with items that you still need to think about. Never leave post-its or ""read later"" items that haven't been filed or dealt with. Check all your important sources of inputs once more before you go. You can find a lot more help on this topic at Productivity SE If that doesn't work... If you have done all the right things during a day, and you've organized all the inputs into future to-dos, your only responsibility listening for a call or email that there is an emergency. If you are responsible for more than just emergencies outside of work hours, or you still just can't disconnect?  You probably need an assistant or a new job.  There's only so much you can do!"
89,I like to ask open questions like: What can you tell me about the project you see starting me out on? From the answer to this question I usually ask about the frameworks and tools they are using for it. I can get engaged with the manager about the position and show how my skills can help there. Not to mention if the manager is on the fence this question can help to push them over and get them thinking how I can fit in their team. It also helps take the temperature of the interview.  A short answer with no thought probably means it is not going well.  It gives you an opportunity to either cut losses or redouble your efforts to make a better impression.
90,"A lot of companies have bus programs where you can get your pass through your employer. This is usually taken out of your pretax pay, but since this is an unpaid internship I'm not sure if you could get something worked out. Companies like this because they get tax credit for subsidizing public transit. Paying for your bus is good for your company and you, win-win! Do some research into your city/state's public transit through work program, and send them some links either after you talk, or in the email you ask about a bus pass in. The more you can do for them on this the better, and that includes the research."
92,"How do I maintain a good relationship with an employer after resigning?. I'm working my first job and would like to have my current boss as a reference if possible. But if I leave, it's almost certainly going to be a resignation to move to another job. I feel like I'm abandoning them and I feel suddenly my previous employer's opinion of me is going to drop substantially. I work in a small department so my leaving would be significant, but I feel my employer knows people in my position often leave; young workers, no real path for upward mobility. The last three employees in my position have moved on. It seems there's a good relationship left with those employees and my coworkers/boss. How can I leave gracefully and maintain my current employer as a reference when I'm ""abandoning"" them? What do I need to do before and after I leave?"
93,Just consider the following issue: No matter how badly we try to keep professional and personal relationships separate we are not able to do that. We are all only human. So is it unprofessional? No. Will it affect how you perform your duties with respect to the site where user is present? Definitely. So my suggestion is to avoid interactions where your professional life bleeds into your personal one.
94,"I always ask one fairly simple question: Did they actually bother to pay attention to my skillset and desires? Seriously, I can't count the number of times I've been approached for leads that have nothing to do with what I've been doing for the past three years. Those, I just ignore them outright. If they can't be bothered to even see that I don't even remotely match what they have, then I can't be bothered to waste my time with them, especially if I know I've kept up with my online profiles*. If they actually appear to have paid attention to what I'm looking for and actually believe me when I say ""I'm a PHP developer, I have no interest in .Net positions,"" then I'll listen to what they have to say. Once that question is answered, I've found it to be no different than if I were to have found their job posting on a board - some are crap, some are diamonds. *For a while, I did make a point to ask them where they found my profile if they seemed like they had genuinely felt that I fit their needs, since there was a chance that they came across an outdated one."
95,"Make the case that you are much more productive at work if you limit your overtime.  Having a life outside of work takes your mind off of the problems you are trying to solve during your work time, and allows you to have a fresh perspective the next day.  If you are a high performer during the hours you are at work, and you meet your milestones, there's not much your team can say about your preference not to work extra hours."
96,"From the perspective of a developer who's not good enough to work for ultra cool, cutting edge Silicon Valley companies, I would say bite the bullet and wear that stupid suit. I look forward to the day when wearing a suit to an interview is seen as silly, but the fact of the matter is there may still be some old fashioned hiring managers out there who think you should dress to impress, and might feel miffed if you show up in just a polo and khakis. Wearing a suit will never cause a manager to not hire you, but, unfortunately showing up dressed too casually may."
97,"I'd offer it would help to be aware of the tradeoffs between home and work. I've noticed myself, that I'll stay at work doing something work-related and interesting, because I'm not happy about some facet of my home life - maybe my house isn't clean, maybe I'm fighting with the significant other, maybe I just don't want to deal with some other fear, concern, frustration or something. Also - look for the difference between work that must be done right now vs. what can be delayed.  Chances are you're understaffed, but that won't change if you are catching all the dropped balls - you're going to have to leave some things undone before you can get help.  As a manger, it'll always be your job to find the less important stuff that you can ignore.  WARNING = the less important stuff may be the most fun stuff. Lastly - it's also time to get in consultation with your management.  They probably love the work you are doing, but don't realize that you might be on the cusp of burning out.  As you start to consider changes to your work life, you probably need to keep them in the loop.  ""Yo, FYI, I'm going to start slacking off"" is probably not the right tone.  But ""hey, we need to talk, I've been working mega overtime, and I will burn out soon if I don't make some changes - can we figure out a clear priority system so I don't loose track of anything critical to the business"" is a much more useful tone..."
98,"Culture is an incredibly powerful thing. Practical answer Culture is hard to change, because it's the momentum that carries any group of people. It's easier to change something about yourself (or your role or your job) than it is to change an organization. Therefore, if you want to decline overtime / overwork without appearing to be slacking then: Try simply declining, but do so without lying about your reasons or motivations - long term, being dishonest isn't healthy. Talk about your stress, or your health, or your outside-of-work priorities, etc. If that doesn't work, or people start to try to shame you for it, consider their response a form of feedback, and decide if you want to work that overtime anyway (adapt yourself to the culture), or if it's important enough to you to move on to another role or another company (leave the culture). If it's important enough to you to try to leave, the sooner you start on this path (talk to your manager, apply for jobs elsewhere, etc.) the better. If you let bitterness build up before you start a plan of action you're much more likely to leave on bad terms, and burn bridges along the way. The sooner you simply move on with respect toward your co-workers, the better it'll be for everyone -- especially yourself. Philosophical answer As a first step I would do a reality check, and make sure that your situation isn't outside what is legal. I don't want you to start some kind of battle with your employer - that pretty much never ends up well - just make sure they're fulfilling their responsibilities as far as this is concerned. Beyond that, like I said, culture is a very powerful thing, and when there's a great fit between the culture you enjoy working in, and the one in which you actually work, it does amazing things for your job satisfaction. I've worked in similar places, and have had similar challenges. In any gathering of humans under any organizational structure, you're going to find that how people have a lot to do with the social norms within that group. In many cases, if this becomes a long-term problem for you, you may need to think about changing your role within the organization (to one that is more to your liking), or searching for a company where you can do similarly fulfilling work, but has a culture that is more in line with your personal beliefs about life, work, outside obligations, etc. Unlike what many believe, not all companies are the same, and cultures within organizations are as diverse as the people who work there. There's way more choice than many people commonly believe in the way work can feel, and how the people around you will naturally approach it when working within various work cultures."
100,"Business relationships can be viewed negatively if they're used as leverage or if they make others uncomfortable (harassment). Since you're not (hopefully) talking about harassment, the relevant thing here is whether or not you gain inappropriate leverage with your user/client/etc. In this case you can't really extort much out of your users; you can't make them buy the Premium Option for $5000 extra because there's no money involved. You're not getting access to insider information because you already have it. You're not going to be able to get a raise or gain additional clout through these interactions, so I don't think they could generally be perceived as inappropriate."
101,"There is no shame in leaving a job to peruse new opportunities.  Most companies will understand this.  Just make sure that if you are leaving, you make sure you give them plenty of time before you are done.  I know 2 weeks is the common, but I would say give them a month.  This will allow them time to get someone in to replace you and maybe even have a bit of a crossover between you and the new person. If you do all this on a good note, give plenty of notice offer to do a crossover/training with new person You will leave on good terms with the boss.  I am sure they will be willing to give you a good reference as long as you have done good at your job. UPDATE: Also a good thing to do if possible and the job allows is to create some sort of ""handover notes"" which could be a binder of tips for the job, things the new person should be aware of with the job, and any and all advice you would give to the new person."
102,"Write up a very respectful letter of resignation, and give it to your boss only after you tell him or her in person that you're leaving. Make it clear in both the letter and your sit-down that you've enjoyed your time there, but are just moving on to another opportunity that's a better fit for you.  And, needless to say, give at least 2 weeks notice. If your boss is any kind of decent person, he or she will understand."
103,"The best possible scenario for you is for you to leave in a situation where they agree that the thing you are leaving for is the best decision for you . In other words: you have an offer in hand that they can't beat.  Or, that you are moving to a new area that is more desirable to you.  Or, that you moving to a job doing something that fits your skillset/goals better than they can. If you leave on a disagreement, it will be on bad terms.  You may be leaving because you ""just can't stand [blank]""; if so, don't tell them (at least in those words) — you need to be more tactful about it and give them a reason that they can't disagree with. Since you mentioned specifically that you might be leaving due to lack of upward mobility, I'll give you an example as I would imagine it: Good :  I've found an opportunity to work at/in [company or industry] and pursue my goals of gaining leadership skills and experience. This shows that you are forward-thinking and puts the onus on them to have shown that they  have leadership skill learning opportunities. Bad :  There seems to be a lot more opportunity for promotion over there. This makes it look like you are just waiting for a promotion to come along (every company believes they have promotion opportunity), as well as displaying ""grass is greener on the other side"" syndrome. Never under any circumstances bad mouth your former employer.  That is not saying you can never relate specific issues you have had in the past but never blame the issue on your employer.  If at worst they put food on your table for a certain amount of time.  Show them respect for that if nothing else.  Future employers will respect that in you."
105,"What steps can I take to be a good boss to a more experienced employee?. I was recently given a small promotion at work, which has included some amount of managing an employee who has been here significantly longer than I have and who has more experience than I do. I want to take full advantage of their expertise and make them feel valued, but it is also important for me to establish some amount of authority and make it clear that I am taking a leadership role. This employee has a tendency to interrupt my training of other employees/my conversations with our mutual superiors in a way that I think negatively impacts establishing myself in this position. Do people have any tips on the best way to maintain a good relationship under these circumstances and generally be a good manager while asserting my authority? I should note that we get along well, and the only real strain has come from them feeling undervalued by our mutual boss. I don't want to compound that, but I don't want the good relationship to be maintained at my expense either.."
106,"How should I accept hurtful feedback from a colleague?. Following a networking event, I was told that I was considered ""embarrassing"" and that my companions did not wish to be associated with me because of this. I personally found this exceedingly hurtful; I consider myself enthusiastic, but fairly professional and respectable. I would grant that my conduct at the event was a bit more casual than perhaps anticipated, but I was found no fault with my behavior until it was pointed out to me -- astonishing because I am usually exceedingly self-conscious and likely to overthink everything. At the time, I stammered something out of no consequence and removed myself from that situation expeditiously. How should I have handled it? How does one accept feedback that is personally hurtful? And, finally, how does one make clear that such feedback was hurtful on a personal level?"
107,"What are some guidelines for appropriate social drinking in a work-related context?. Everyone or nearly everyone has at some point an occasion to drink either at work as part of a work function or with a group of friends from work. What are some ways to help avoid the pitfalls of drinking with colleagues while still reaping some of the benefits? I realize this may be dependent on the situation and the people involved. For instance, drinking at a holiday party for an accounting firm might be different than drinking with your good friends who you work with at the accounting firm, which may be different than drinking at your desk at a funky startup. Are there any general rules other than knowing your own limits? When is it ok to be comfortable enough to drink with work colleagues. Keep in mind that drinking can be great until someone gets too comfortable and says something they regret. Knowing that it's a possibility for things to be said or done that can't be unsaid or undone (either by yourself or a colleague you're drinking with), is it ever worth the risk?"
108,"Just like your resume, your attire should follow the company's culture. But I've always played it safe. And it's worked so far :) If you are interviewing for big companies that are fairly known as formal (IBM, Microsoft, etc.), wear a suit. Everyone else (small or laid-back companies)? Just lose the tie and the suit jacket. Keep the shoes, the pants and the shirt. You still look very professional, just a little less formal than suit."
109,"I'm going to run counter to the answer so far that say ""if in doubt, wear a suit"".  I agree with the referenced quote - developers typically do not wear suits, they wear upscale business casual - slacks, khakis, sweaters, polo shirts, button down shirts or similar (and female equivalents).  Rarely in the last 10 years have I interviewed a technical professional in a suit, tie or even a jacket - and those rare occasions are usually college students. That said - when interviewing for a management or customer-facing position, I'd say it's still advisable to wear a suit.  Similiarly, if you plan to market your strong suit as presentations and/or soft skills to non-technical people - wear a suit - show that you know how to dress well. But, by and large, development has become such a dress-down game, that I don't feel a suit works to one's best advantage - it often strikes me as a little too old school or as if the applicant isn't aware of current norms. To circle round, though - I really don't think I'd turn down or accept an applicant based on whether they missed the boat on suit vs. business casual.  Being obviously dirty, offensively dressed, or vulgar might rule a candidate out, but once we get within the range of professional attire, its what's in the candidate's head that matters."
111,"How do I coordinate the process of pursuing multiple job opportunities at the same time?. In the hot field of software engineering, a competent programmer wanting to switch jobs will be able to apply and interview easily for at least a half dozen jobs. However, coordinating the speed at which the interview and eventually offer process occurs can be a nightmare. For example, I interview for companies A, B, and C, all of which I have a serious interest in. Companies A & B move quickly and both have offers on the table within 2-3 weeks. However company C was slow getting into the game and just began interviewing me. If I am interested also in company C, how do I appropriately stall companies A & B for more time without upsetting anyone? What is the professional manner in which this should be handled? You can't just aggressively push company 'C', but at the same time you can't just tell companies A & B ""Thanks for the offers. I need 3 weeks to think it over please."" What is the proper and professional way to handle/coordinate/juggle the interviewing and offer process when pursuing a new job?"
112,"In my experience, it still absolutely depends on where you are interviewing.  Here's some generally-applicable advice: Err on the side of over-dressing .  The worst reaction you'll get is a ""Make sure not to wear that tie to work!"" joke.  Usually, no harm done for overdressing. If it's a technical position for a financial firm or similar, wear a suit or at a minimum a collared shirt, slacks, and tie. If it's a software company, I'd go slacks, collared shirt (long sleeve) and tie (or similar business casual for women). Everyone there is probably wearing jeans, but wearing jeans to an interview is still a mistake, I believe."
113,When you are called for an interview it is perfectly acceptable to inform the company that you have a specific expectation of salary.  This has the down side of potentially cutting your salary if your rate is lower than their target rate.  But this will help to make sure that your rate is acceptable to the firm doing the interview as the managers time is too valuable to waste on a candidate that is out of their price range. One of the advantages of working with recruiting firms is they have a history of working with the companies and usually have a salary range for the position early on.
114,If the most common way of hiring in the market is through a recruiter I would suggest talking to them about the caliber of people and finding out what it would take to get them for you.  Unfortunately a lot of recruiters don't have the internal vetting process to get bad candidates out and you will have to drop those and find someone who does same as you would find a developer. It is possible that the people you are looking for may be worth more then what you are offering.  I'd look at Salary.com to get a feel if you are even in the market for what you need.
115,"If you're taking a humorous or generally entertaining tone in your resume, then something like ""Guru"" or ""Genius"" can work to convey your point.  However, in a serious context, these terms come across poorly.  Further, a failed attempt at humor comes across even worse.  I'd also be cautious of a phrase like ""resident expert"" as someone may believe that you're overvaluing your position/contribution and may consider yourself irreplaceable. I would advise against attempting to come up with a short phrase to encapsulate all that you do and provide in this spectrum and would rather add a bullet point as a part of your duties with supplemental bullet points for reinforcement: Position X at Widget Corp, Technical Person, 2001 - Present Responsible for managing the X process Lead team of people to do Y Serve as a resource for advice and guidance on technical issues to management and other technical teams. etc, etc..."
116,"Is it okay to ask for a reference soon after meeting my superior?. At what time is it ""too soon"" to ask for a reference from a superior? My reference list looks rather bland, and the reference would serve towards an internship in another career field. When is the greatest time to ask for a reference?"
117,"However, I have trouble pulling myself away from my work. I know exactly what you mean. As others have suggested already, the goal is to achieve a life balance which suits your needs and objectives. This can be hard to do, particularly when things need fixing right now this instant . Having worked on maintaining a web service whos customers were online during the middle of the night, I deduced the following as simple rules: Talk to your employer about flexible hours. If you are required to work support over a weekend unexpectedly, rather than claiming overtime, ask for time off in lieu. If your employer agrees to the above, excellent, but if not, decide what you feel a reasonable commitment is out of hours. Stick to those rules. Barriers are a good idea and many people have suggested work/home issue separation, but I'd go one further: if you can, only do work at work and only do home at home. Obviously, this is not always a practical arrangement, but if you're breaking it, that's the time to say ""I am crossing a boundary: am I ok with this?"" Realise that in some jurisdictions, you are entitled to reasonable and necessary time off for things like medical appointments etc. Take it. Take holiday. All of it. Even if you have no plans. Luckily, my employer was quite flexible about my working varied hours, on the understanding that when they needed me, I would endeavour to be there, but then when I needed to do something, I also could. If your employer is putting pressure on you to work long hours without overtime or time off in lieu, this may be a breach of your contract and may also be illegal. I would suggest getting advice over the internet on such matters is not the best idea! Usually, if you feel you cannot talk to HR, for example in the UK we provide something called the Citizens Advice Burea which provide impartial advice and contacts."
118,"Switching jobs - how soon is too soon?. My current (and first) job as a junior developer is ending and I need to look for a new one.  I've received a fairly appealing offer in town, but for a variety of reasons I expect I might relocate soon.  This new job will provide me with training in new technologies which would make me more marketable. While my concern ultimately has to be for myself, I'd like to deal as ethically as possible with my employers, as well as burn as few bridges as possible. What I'd like to know is - how long should one reasonably stick around at a new job?  How much of a black mark is a short employment span going to be for future employers?"
120,"As already mentioned here, this is a dangerous area. Proceed with caution. When in doubt, do not drink at all! Be advised that some people will evaluate you from how you behave in office parties. That is human nature. If you can keep it cool and loosen up a bit, it will be fine. Also no one needs to drink to do that. Swimming in the fountain is not fine. If there's ever a chance to lose the cool, don't drink at all. Don't be Meredith :) Rule of thumb for me: at office parties, I drink at most 2 beers OR 2 glasses of wine OR 1 glass of whiskey. Personally, I learned that's an amount that does not affect my judgement but allows me to be seen socially drinking make it easier for me to join the CEO for a smart talk ;) Adjust the amounts to yourself. Socially drinking is an art. If you are not sure how to do it, don't do it at all."
121,You ask for a letter of reference when you are looking to leave your position.  If you have the support of your manager for that move then any time should be fine.  However if you have just started a position then asking for a reference right away is beyond presumptuous. The best thing to do is to cultivate a professional relationship with your direct supervisor.  This way you can get their help in developing your career.  If you do this when you it is right for you to move on you will probably have their support.  This will also help turn a neutral reference into a more positive reference that will serve you much better.
122,"Should I describe myself by my current position or my desired position?. I currently am a programmer in job title and largely what I do. However, I am applying for UX/UI/ect Design (and front end development) positions. My current skills are important for the positions I'm looking for, but ""programmer"" just sounds like a poor match. I really don't want to come off as a programmer applying for a design job; I have design experience, I do front end design at my current job, I have an education background that supporting UX design. At the same time, I don't want to come off as a liar, saying I'm a UI Designer when my resume clearly states my current title is Programmer at Such A Company. Which title do I chose for my elevator pitch? The position I want, the position I have, or something in between that applies to both?"
123,"Removing yourself from the situation was a good call. Reacting in an emotional manner (aggresive, defensive, upset, etc.) is not a great idea on the spot. Usually in a time like this it works best to work with the facts of what occured and focus feedback and responses from what actually occured. Do not let past occurances unrelated slip into the conversation and make this into a bigger deal than what occured. The main step is to speak offline in private 1 on 1 with the person who provided the feedback. Tell them it caught you off guard and expalin (as you did above) your line of thinking and what you feel occured. The goal is that you each tell your side of what happened and hope that something productive occus from the situation. Sometime the productive byproduct in a situation like this is learning more about your peers and what is acceptable in the wrok environment. As far as feeling offended or hurt, that's natural. No one likes to hear what they have done wrong. Most say ""Oh yeah I love constructive criticism"", but in reality very few do. At the end of the day be honest with yourself. If you were a bit out of line, thank the person for the feedback and consider it a learning experience. If you feel you were truly mistreated or scolded inappropriately, then the 1 on 1 conversation will hopefully sort that issue out so that you may be understood better."
124,"You don't have to respond immediately; what you did was fine.  But sometime when you've recovered it might be worth drilling into this - what about your behavior was ""embarrassing"" to the person who said this?  Is this opinion truly widely shared?  Do you have a confidant you can go to who can give you some coaching or feedback in this area? Look, if you snort when you laugh and some hipsters don't like this, too bad for them.  But if you have an awful habit of which you're unaware, it's worth your while to find out about it even if it causes you some pain."
125,This will depend on the culture - both the country/area and the company. There may also be regulations (health and safely etc.) that mean you can't drink alcohol during work hours. If you are representing the company in any capacity then not drinking alcohol is probably the best bet. You are far less likely to make any faux pas if you are not even remotely drunk. For a social event you still might want to drink less than you normally would. Any drunken behaviour will be noticed and at least commented on the next working day. I worked at one company where someone got fired for their behaviour at the Christmas party.
126,"I can tell you that I am on the side of the table that does hiring for programmers and jumping around year after year is indeed a black mark IMO. However you have a legitimate and valid case for switching jobs due to the relocation. If I asked ""Why were you only at job 'X' for 6 months"", and you stated ""It was a fantastic opportunity to do X,Y,and Z, but I had to leave because we relocated"", then that black mark would turn into a gold star. Also at this point in your career switching jobs to gain valuable experience and not get bogged down by 1 companies ""way of developing"" will make you a far superior candidate in the long run."
127,"Depending on the trust you have with your boss, you might consider the radical idea (not for everyone or every situation) of talking to your boss BEFORE you accept an offer.  Your level of security with this concept can range from gutsy (talk before putting resume on job search sites) to conservative (talk when offer letter is in hand, but before saying ""yes"").  But it doesn't always hurt to have the conversation of ""I don't see what I want in the time I want it if I stay here... am I right?"" For the record, I actually had exactly that discussion with a former boss this year just before I left.  Not only did he provide good thoughts at the time, but when I decided to leave the company he was a rock of stability in a very hard descision and we've kept up correspondence since. If you don't feel comfortable with that, I say: have a polite offer letter that you deliver in person with verbal notification first.  You may even want to schedule a half hour on your boss' calendar so they have time to talk it over with you. be ready to give MINIMUM 2 weeks notice, but if possible, be open to considerations.  The company may or may not want more time from you - know what your new position can handle.  Also- be aware of any huge balls in the air in your current assignments as you communicate with upcoming offers.  It's commendable to lay out a time line with the new company that reflects a graceful hand off in the old place - it tells your new employers that you will extend the same courtesy to them shoudl you ever leave. in the time remaining between resignation and departure - be a class act.  Get any lingering commitments solidly completed OR train someone on the team to pick it up confidently.  Figure out key areas you are the expert in and volunteer to do training.  Don't take on new work - offer to mentor others.  Avoid slacking off on the work, don't be late, continue to be engaged.  In most healthy organizations, it's likely that you will not have useful work in the last few days, so make yourself present and available to be a sounding board for crises. be aware of the resignation processes in your company - vacation time, health benefits, etc. - each company has their own rules about the weeks after you give notice. hand in everything the company gave you.  Be ahead of the curve - have a checklist that you vet with your boss so that you both agree that nothing got misses (laptops, USB sticks, books, cell phone, etc.) work with your boss to identify and notify external groups you may work with.  It may be that the boss wants to make this notification himself so he can manage the handoff - so be respectful of that. send a nice, well thought out good bye letter on the last day.  It's usually acceptable to provide personal contact information if you feel comfortable with that. be sure to make personal contact with anyone you want to remain in touch with to exchange info (ie, don't just send your personal info and hope they write... ask for theirs and write yourself). A smart boss will see that a departing person is not an enemy, but a future employee.  If a smart person goes away and gets a great new job, then it's likely that they may be available in the future, with even more great experience.  So a smart boss will not see it as a betrayal, but as a way to expand their own network. The ""Two Weeks"" In the US a common norm is to give 2 weeks notice - regardless of what's legally required by contract or by law in most positions, this is the standard for what's considered polite.  Other countries have other norms, but I've noticed through Workplace threads, that there is quite often a norm for what's ""abrupt"" vs. ""normal"". To address the comment thread that grew up around this answer - it's good, if possible to be ready and able to give the standard polite length notice.  Don't put yourself deliberately into a position where this is absolutely impossible if you avoid it.  Realize that mileage will vary remarkably, and it's hard to address a single unified rule here, there's only a few guidelines: High risk, high security type positions - like system administrators, people working on highly classified work, or in particularly vital business areas may give the standard two weeks, and then be terminated THAT DAY.  Quite often, when the company chooses to do this, it also chooses to pay those two weeks, but it isn't a given.  Sadly, word of mouth may be the best way to find out if this is the standard in a given company. Good reasons do count for something - provided they are real.  Dramatic family problems that require relocation (very ill family member), once and a life time opportunities (getting cast on America's Next Top Model) - things like this can count with a good boss or a caring company - but realize that lying is just not that hard to discover, and lying about a reason for leaving to avoid giving two weeks won't make you look good. Variations on the ""I just don't want to stick around"" don't count for much.  Two weeks isn't all that long to wait - for either you or your new employer - and it can make a big difference to the hand off process.  In a large enough company, it can even take 2 weeks to tell everyone that might want to know and say good bye to them.  Cutting it short for a less than serious reason is somewhat remarkable and may well stick in the minds of those you work with as ""he didn't care enough to give us two weeks to make sure we got his work covered"".  Not an impression that I would wish to leave on my fellow coworkers. It's a courtesy, not a requirement.  But saying ""hey, it's not required, so I don't need to do it"", is rather like foregoing most other social courtesies - no, you don't have to do them and skipping a few here and there makes you merely quirky.  But this is the last impression of you.  People remember.  And it is more than just your boss who get affected here - you're part of a team, and the team wants to continue to do its work well after you leave."
128,"No it's not ok.  You need to have a track record of meeting that person's expectations before you ask (and they give you) a reference worth having.  Imagine how embarrassed you would be if they said, ""Well, Lance really didn't work for me for that long, so I don't know how strongly I can recommend him."""
129,"It sounds like you are asking how to deal with it in the moment, not in the long term.  I'll try to help with both. Why would someone say such a thing? Knowing how to react is going to require understanding why a person would say something like that. They may have been uncomfortable and were carelessly expressing their feelings, either rightly or wrongly. They may be entirely wrong and are simply trying to tear you down. They may have no regard for your feelings and were calling it as they see it. In the moment Reacting appropriately in the moment is something that comes natural to some people and takes endless training for others (like myself). If you are simply so surprised that you are speechless, I would either do as you did, thank them and leave, or simply ask a question:  ""Can you please explain? I'm not sure I understand."" If they are asserting that others share their opinion as well, I wouldn't hesitate to ask them to back that up.  When it's about something negative, they really shouldn't be speaking for others, anyway. If you believe they've expressed all they can and you'd like to not dig into it any further, simply apologize in a polite, but ambiguous way: ""I'm sorry that what I've done has caused you to feel that way, I'll consider that in the future."" Unfortunately, in a professional setting, there's probably not much benefit from letting someone know that something was hurtful.  Taking the high road will be seen as gracious by better people, and a hurtful person is probably not going to recognize the problem.  A careless person could end up simply blaming you for taking offense. Afterward The only approach is to remove your bias and be rational. The feedback could be completely wrong; after all, smart rational people are usually also tactful.  If you consider the feedback carefully, solicit some opinions, and can't find anything you could have done better, then I would move on and don't let it hurt you. The feedback could be correct, but only from a certain perspective. Some people dislike overly-casual people.  Others may really like casual people.  So, you may not need to change anything.  Often, those people that dislike overly-casual people believe that everyone else sees the world as they do, when that's not the case. Maybe you could have done something better, but the feedback was expressed in a clumsy, inaccurate or overly-hurtful manner. In this case, maybe you could find something you said that you shouldn't have, and you can be more careful in the future, but this person was equally inconsiderate in expressing something they weren't prepared to communicate constructively. The feedback is correct but blunt. Hopefully this isn't the case;  From the professional and thoughtful manner in which you asked this question, I would guess it is not."
130,"The difference between constructive criticism and not is often clear.  You need to separate what's constructive in their criticism (specific behaviors that can be avoided) and what is not (name-calling, ad hominem attacks, irrelevant details, etc.)
If they were vague in their criticism, you can follow up later and ask for specifics in how to improve yourself.  If they said some things that were uncalled for, you can mention that ""this was not necessary and irrelevant to improving the situation"""
131,"Is there an optimal number of years per job as an engineer?. Some (software) engineers keep their job for very short periods of time, as if they have commitment issues. Some keep their job for too long, as if they're afraid to leave their safety zone. Is there a ""right"" number of years per job for a (software) engineer, or does it matter?"
132,"How honest should I be in performance reviews about colleagues?. When I was working in student government during university, I would occasionally be asked to provide anonymous feedback about one of my colleagues. I was assured this feedback would be seen only by our advisor and the administration president. How honest should I be in performance review feedback items such as this? I like to believe that I provide constructive criticism in my insights/observations, but I'm curious if there are limits to how honest one should be about one's colleagues' performance."
133,"Don't get drunk around coworkers. By all means drink if you feel comfortable and you feel it appears acceptable. Whether you're at a holiday party or at a bar after work it's okay to drink enough to get a little buzz if you want, but don't let others pressure you into drinking, don't drink more than anyone else, and don't drink more than you can handle. It always depends on the group of people you're with of course; some companies might be perfectly happy to let all of their employees get wasted, but that's generally not going to be the case . If you feel that drinking any more will inhibit your ability to act professionally at a work-related party, stop drinking . Even if you don't feel that way, don't lead the drinking; you don't want to look like a booze hound even if you're not actually drunk. It's all about appearance. Even if these people are your friends, they are still your coworkers . You don't want to start arguments or rumors floating about regardless of how comfortable you are around your coworkers or how comfortable you think they are with you."
134,"I was considered ""embarrassing"" and that my companions did not wish to be associated with me because of this ...seems a bit emotionally charged, and I wouldn't consider it valuable feedback. If you have doubts about your conduct, you should ask someone else that was present for feedback, and it wouldn't hurt to gather similar feedback for past events. And never bother responding. I understand that the moment was awkward and hurtful, but you'll need to toughen up a bit and deal with it: Smile, thank them for their feedback, ensure them you'll take it under consideration and walk away. If you manage to keep smiling while you do all that, it'll confuse them even more ;)"
135,"Use your title as anyone doing a reference check may throw you out if it doesn't match what the reference check says. If you feel the title is too far off,  add the realistic title of what you did in parentheses after the official title. Then explain why you did that in the cover letter. What you want to do is make sure the description of the job includes the information about what design tasks you performed."
136,"How to work on my personal ideas during the weekend. I'm working full time 5 days a week, mostly between 10 and 14 hours a day. At the end of the day I'm very tired and just want to take a shower, hang out and go to sleep. I have a lot of ideas that I want to implement and someday sell maybe through an online software business. I have my weekends free. However, when I get to the weekend I can't even imagine myself turning on the computer. But I really want to make my ideas happen, and I can't leave my job right now to devote myself only to my ideas. What do you say? Do you find some method helpful? Do you use some technique?"
137,"Normally in this case I would suggest limiting the number of companies you are pursuing. If you are interested in company C more then A&B I would suggest simply contacting them and telling them that you need ""a few more days to make a decision"".  The problem with 3 weeks is that most companies won't keep the offers open for that long unless they are really desperate. What you could also do is to call company C and tell them that you have received and offer but you would like to work for the company C and ask them what your chances might be to get an offer from them.  Possibility of doing that would of course depend on what stage of the interview process you are in. Of course you could go a different route:  You can tell companies A & B or just one of them that you would like to accept their offer but have a 4 week notice period and then refuse to start with them if the offer from company C comes through.  Of course this will probably kill your chances to ever work for company A again but then you might get your dream job at company C and never have to worry about it."
138,"How can I ask for more positive reinforcement?. I found out that what fuels me to do well at work is positive reinforcement from bosses, colleagues, and customers. My current job at a start-up is very demanding. My boss doesn't have time to give positive reinforcement, and I'm always behind schedule, so maybe I haven't earned them. On the other hand, I don't get negative reinforcement either, so I don't feel like I'm performing badly. How have other people communicated their need for positive reinforcement to their bosses?"
139,I always try to customize my resume for the position I am looking for. The person looking to fill the job I want does not care about the skills I have that are not important to it.  Always try to emphasize what is important to the position you are applying for. List any skills you used in your former position(s) that is being sought in the new position. You can use the title that you have.  Most employers realize that titles are just that.  They look at the skill sets that were important to the position.
140,"Use your current job/role title on your resume ..but clearly describe the transferable skills you are looking to take forward. Some recruiters will see inaccuracy/exaggeration on your resume as indicative of other problems and reject you. It may not be the prospective employer who does this - it is common to use a third party agency to do routine background checks. In some territories it can be construed as fraud to embellish your resume, so keep it truthful. Your cover letter and/or objective statement should describe that you're looking to move across roles. If you are moving companies, it may be easier to apply for the same role as you're currently doing and then transfer internally when you get there."
141,"I do a lot of hiring at my current position and nothing wastes more time than going through multiple interviews and then finding out 1 party was way off on the salary figure. This is something that should and needs to be discussed up front. There are several avenues to do this: On your employment profile (i.e. Dice, Monster, etc.) - specify your salary range. If contacted by or using a recuiter this is absolutely an easy conversation. Just state: ""As you may have seen my salary range was between ""$xx,000 and $yy,000. Is the position offered in this range?"" Initial phone screening: typically this is done by a higher level HR representative feeling out if it is even worth passing you on to the next level. They will be at least partially involved with salary, so the same question from above could be presented to them. If in some case your 1st interview was directly with the department applied for, then I recommend at some point during the 1st interview eluding to when is the appropriate time to discuss the ""compensation package"" being offered. In any regard, don't waste your time or the potential employer's time if the salary value is important to you. If it is not written in the description, then use a method above to find out early about it to see if the job is worth pursuing."
142,"How does one accept feedback that is personally hurtful? Welcome to work. We've all had a time in our lives where a boss, colleague or subordinate has decided for whatever reason to criticise. It comes down to two sides of the coin: The colleague may not have handled the interaction well at all, for a variety of reasons including work and personal life issues. You may have overreacted to the feedback, or misinterpreted it or taken it badly as a result of however you were feeling at the time. In light of this, one of the best things to do (and you did) is to leave and then process this. I spent quite a lot of time doing CBT and the technique we'd use here would be to draw a nice table: Statement: Ninefingers is really annoying at work. Evidence For Evidence Against Yes, I have a tendency to joke around However, we do have a joke culture in the office Sometimes, I think my colleagues find me overbearing My joking is mostly infrequent. My jokes are funny, whereas what Fred says is downright inappropriate. This is a contrived, silly example but what we're doing here is to rationalise the statement, decide how much we actually agree with it and then work out if the criticism is actually based on something we want to change, or not. The idea is to be honest, place evidence in each of the columns based on observable facts and come to a conclusion. One avenue is to seek the opinions of other colleagues; however, I would avoid mentioning that it is in response to criticism. For example, you might have received the criticism in my table and ask a colleague: Fred, do you think I need to tone down by humour a little? This will give you a third party perspective, which can be vital, especially if you tend to be very self-critical."
143,"In the case where a substantial amount of money may be paid to train you or ramp you up, you may wish to ponder the idea of notifying your employers before you take the job.  You may even want to do that by asking directly if there is a sign-on obligation (for example, a commitment to stay for a year after training).  Not every position requires a lot of training, or this type of commitment. For the record, from a management perspective, it takes about 6 months to ramp up just about anybody - in the 0-6 range, the person is more of a liability than an asset as they are (rightfully) asking for help and instructions from the team, so the overall team is less efficient and the new guy isn't productive enough to make up for the overhead of question-answering.  At 6-12 months, the ratio levels out - the new guy is more produtive and asks less questions (cause he has the clue!) and he's doing meaningfull work.  He is probably not 100% efficient yet, but the team as a whole is now more productive than they were before the new guy joined.  The new guy usually amortizes on the investment in his second year - somewhere between 18 and 24 months into the situation. If you are really sure you're relocating, give your employer a heads up.  While you probably won't destroy your career (the world is a big place, and blacklisting is nearly impossible), it's ethical to let them know. I agree with @atconway that multiple career jumps in a full-time employee is a danger sign.  One jump, because of a relocation - is not a killer - but in terms of burning bridges, I think you need to be fair to your incipient employeer on your short term plans. The metric for ""normal"" career changes these days is usually 3 years."
145,Questions related to personal relationships in a work context.
146,"It also depends on who you are dealing with. If the position is being handled via head hunter, salary expectations is one of the first topic to get a matched upon. If the position is not through a head hunter, the best possible point to ask the question is in the second round interviews. The first round interview is for that initial to get a general indication that both parties are a relatively good fit, skill wise. The second round is usually for the administrative part of the position, eg salary or package."
147,"There is an unfortunate reality of doing these kinds of reviews: Everything hidden becomes known even if the feedback could only be seen by an advisor or administration president. If a person performing the review mentions some of your constructive criticisms to a person, there are ways of determining who left it, so be careful of being too insightful if you have to continue working with these people. If you want to leave criticism leave them as generic as possible."
148,"It depends on what you want to get out of your career. If you want to have a lot of experience in different areas of expertise, then you could move around every few years.  The reason being you want to grow and you want to enhance your skills. However, if you feel you are growing in your career (and getting promoted) and you are working for your dream company (Microsoft/Apple for example), you could stay there for 20 years if you wanted."
149,"How do I motivate my colleagues?. Sometimes I have to work with a particular colleague on my team; the problem is, in my opinion, that he takes his work too lightly. When I start a job, I commit to it and want to meet my deadlines and provide a decent product (I'm a programmer). My colleague just wants to make it work, but doesn't think about maintainability, documentation, etc. I feel like his attitude might affect our project and is the basis for some frustration. How do I motivate him? How do I bring up that I don't like the way we are working at the moment?"
150,"This is a very tough one.  I've been in peer review processes that are similar — that specifically ask for ""something they could do better"". Here's how I approach it: Be as honest as possible, but only about things you believe will help the team.  There's no use pointing out a character flaw where there is no possibility of helping the team improve. Keep in mind that, as a peer, your perspective on the issue is limited Try to relate it to their strengths .  ""While he does such a good job focusing on X, paying more attention to Y might produce even better results"" Keep in mind that some people are just different, and that's why teams can work so well. Sometimes telling a person to be better at Y will make them worse at X .  This is where managers and peers should recognize each others' strengths and help make the puzzle fit in the best way possible. I actually like thinking about it the way the question was phrased on our surveys:  "" Describe how [person] can be more effective in their role .""  This helps me frame all feedback in a positive light, not negative."
151,"Totally depends on the industry/job you are in, and want to have, as well as many factors outside your control. Just like in writing software itself, ""optimal"" in the real world is a combination of factors, applied to the problem you're trying to solve. I don't think there's a canonical answer to something like this. The combination of factors that will, or will not, get you a particular role are complicated and unique depending on the exact moment in time when you apply, the experience you have at that time, what a potential job might require, and lots of other factors in the larger world that you have no control over: i.e. the market for such jobs."
152,"... I was considered ""embarrassing"" and that my companions did not wish to be associated with me because of this... I consider this statement to be abusive.  Making vague allegations backed by vague references like ""Everyone else thinks so too"" is a common tactic of abusers.  Someone who wanted to help you would have given you specific advice, and left out the part about ""Everyone else"". This remark may say much more about your critic than it does about you.  If you report to this person, directly or indirectly, then you are in trouble and should be seeking other opportunities.  Things will only get worse. If the critic is merely a colleague, then I would go talk to your supervisor, or other colleagues who were present and get their opinion.  If they agree (unlikely IMO), then of course you want to find out what specific behavior was a problem, and correct it. If your colleagues don't have a problem, then the critic is simply malicious.  You need to be extremely careful in your interactions with the critic.  Avoid him or her as much as possible. Do not share any information unless absolutely necessary to perform your job. Do not take any action based solely on verbal communication. Follow up any verbal agreements with an E-mail confirmation. Keep a private log (time, date, specific wording) of any unpleasant remarks, starting with the one you have already reported.  In short, Cover Your Ass.  It's quite possible you have never met anyone this nasty before."
153,"This problem should never have arisen, so I suspect it will not get solve without drastic action. You need to create a crisis . Inform your boss of the problem. Request time to train coworkers and document key procedures. Inform them of a long holiday you will take in a few months during which you will be uncontactable . If you do this you will force them to face up to the problem. Also realise that you are not indispensable . As Charles de Gaulle said, ""The graveyards are full of indispensable men."""
154,"How do you criticize/give feedback someone's work without demotivating them?. How do you criticize/give feedback someone's work without demotivating them? If you need to review someone's work, how do you prevent demotivating them when they did a bad job?"
155,"I pick it depending on who I'm speaking to as follows: external recruiter - I ask immediately.  I hear the title, the location and if I don't hear a ball park range, I ask.  If the recruiter is no where near close to my current salary, I tell them so.  When headhunters are trying to make a match, I have found that (at least this year, in Boston) they will hit up virtually anyone with a resume that looks remotely close, so I've had several that want me to take an 8 year step backward in my career for a $50K pay cut.  That's not OK, and not worth my time, and while I'd think my resume would make that clear, experience has proven otherwise. internal recruiter - ie, someone in the company's HR department - can usually speak in depth about the position.  Largely depends on my read of the person.  It's not usual for me to say - ""where in your process would you be open to discussing salary?  Just so you know, I'm happy enough at my current position to be unwilling to take a pay cut.""  Which has always been true. technical interview - almost never, unless the technical interview is with the hiring manager.  Usually it is not, it is with a fellow geek. interview with hiring manager - on the phone - probably not.  But I expect that my first phone chat with a hiring manager will be shortly followed with either a ""no thanks"" or an invite into the office. in the company's location - Frankly, if I have shlepped out to the company's location, I darn well expect to know the potential salary.  Usually at this point, I'm 85% confident they can meet my ballpark.  I expect that towards the end of my visit, either the hiring manger or the HR rep will bring it up and ask me what I make.  There's all sorts of philosophies on this (many of them on programmers.stackexchange) - pick your favorite.  If I don't have this conversation at the location, then any positive follow up call will be asked quite bluntly. In the last job hunt, I figured out quickly that my strategy had to be minimum time-wasting.  At least in the tech industry, there is more demand than there are jobs, so any resume seems to get a flood of calls - many of which may be hardly better than spam. I couldn't allow the non-productive conversations to screen the productive opportunities... so I had to be blunt when I had reason to believe that the particular communication channel was unlikely to result in useful opportunities."
156,"Keep your job as long as you're learning, growing and improving every year.  If you start to stagnate, that's a signal that it's time to move on. If you're being interviewed, be prepared to answer questions on both ends of the spectrum: Why did you leave so soon? Why did you stay there so long?  What did you do to keep growing in the same place?"
157,"Will there come a time when we don't send resumes around, just
  hyperlinks to online profiles such as LinkedIn? That's difficult to say. Without being able to predict what you will need in the future it's best to spend the few hours to have the .doc version ready. My experience has been you need to have both fully complete and ready at hand. Some especially recruiters will feed off of online material, but watch them eventually ask for a .doc version when submitting your information to an employer."
158,"Workplace gossip makes me uncomfortable - how do I deal with it?. At some of my jobs people love to gossip about each other. I don't like to participate in gossip. I've found that if I speak up to tell these people that I believe gossipping is bad, I become a bigger target for the gossip itself. Am I right to try to stop gossip from occurring?  If so, how can I address it without causing problems or making myself a target?"
159,"The best way to answer this question is to think about it slightly differently: how do you best sell the idea to your colleague that you being their boss is a good thing? The easiest way to do that is to give them the recognition that they feel your mutual boss denies them, and to promote them to your mutual boss in front of them (and others). This way, you become an asset to them, and not a barrier. As for the interruptions, well, that may be a bit trickier. Depending on your relationship, it may be possible to bring this up in a direct manner, but remember to sell it to them in terms of how it hurts them (which they ultimately care about), not in terms of how it affects you (which they ultimately don't). It all comes back to Jerry Maguire: ""Help me help you!"""
160,"How would a teacher do it? Find the positives, and talk about those. Ask questions so that you understand their thinking. Then, ask questions that lead them to the right answer. After all, if you can't connect the dots between the problem and a better solution, then they aren't going to learn anything from the process.  So, you have to help them solve the problem themselves."
161,"Openly, honestly, and in a culture that emphasises learning from mistakes instead of punishing failure. Without that, it's very very hard."
163,"Stay away. Don't get involved in that slippery slope. My recommendation is to walk away from those types of conversations or steer it back to a work-related matter. Another alternative if in a casual setting (like a lunch break) is to change the subject to something positive that everyone will enjoy discussing. At the end of the day it is completely unprofessional, and leads to nothing positive or productive."
164,"Make it less about the work ethic (real or perceived), and make it about the task at hand, deliverables, and making sure the work meets your expectations. In order to do that, you'll need to communicate your expectations, from timelines to quality, to whatever else are the important criteria for you. These things take time and dedicated training. You've identified the problem (the perceived gap in delivery quality, based on a set of criteria). Simply pointing it out to the other person won't fix it - you have to be clear when expectations are met, exceeded, and left wanting. Humans are pattern-matching creatures - co-workers generally pick up on things when the goals are well defined. I could probably point you toward some more specific resources, if you want to be more specific about the kinds of challenges you're having with this individual. Quality/speed/delivery issues are common, but rather broad, and as a result, difficult to answer with a ""silver bullet"" approach. You really need to dig into the specifics if you want to make a lasting, and high-quality change in the people around you."
165,"You are definitely setting the example by not participating.  After that, it just depends on how assertive you want to be.  For example, I had a friend who used to say things like, ""Is this a positive, uplifting conversation that will help us all move
  forward?"" Feel free to paraphrase or borrow outright. The other discipline I find useful is to reflect on the Rotary Four Way Test ."
166,"How to lead teams to turn criticism into collaboration. As a designated leader who has gotten the respect of those I lead - here's a problem I've had before.  When working on project is where there are other potential leaders with strong opinions, I've the problem that others challenge my authority as a leader by being critical of solutions without offering better alternatives. How do I derail this negative, critical behavior to lead a more collaborative, solution-focused team?"
167,"Asking client for a letter of recommendation. I'm a software developer working at a company with several clients. Part of my job is to stay in touch with clients and make sure the software I'm developing for them fulfills their needs. Additionally, I'm the go-to guy for documentation, issues, technical discussion, future development, etc. Over the years I've naturally developed more than software: a reputation with people (some in far away places), which I could describe as both professional and friendly. They are often project managers or middle management. If I quit my current job can I ethically ask these clients for letters of recommendation?"
168,"As a peer, how can I provide leadership for my team?. I have been listening to a lot of leadership podcasts.  One was an interview with former Indianapolis Colts' Super Bowl-winning coach Tony Dungy , who wrote a book titled The Mentor Leader: Secrets to Building People and Teams That Win Consistently . Tony Dungy is a champion of the idea that the teams that win are the teams with the most unity of purpose, not the teams with the absolute best players. I am not a direct leader of my team, and our team does not have a manager who works on the same day-to-day items.  Sometimes I feel like we lack unity of purpose, and I would like to help its growth. How can I improve my team's unity, and provide general leadership without entering into any of the potential pitfalls? Is setting an example the only way?"
169,"Absolutely yes.  And as a hiring manager, I would be very impressed by this. It shows initiative and self-confidence. Most people just list their old bosses or co-workers. This means you really connected with clients and helped meet their needs, and impressed them enough that they remembered you among the armies of drones and clock-watchers they likely had to deal with."
170,"Definitely ok. Even better, and what seems to be more and more common these days, would be to ask for a recommendation on a LinkedIn profile, which is visible to all future employers as well. It's also not a bad idea to ask for such recommendations before you're leaving a job, especially if you've done outstanding work on a particular, critical project, and may or may not have the opportunity to work for that client again in the future."
171,"Change the topic, shrug your shoulders, find a reason to leave the conversation. Don't defend or attack anyone, don't let the gossip thrive. If you're in a group and someone starts gossiping, change the subject or revive the topic you were talking about before the gossip. Chances are if you're in a group of people someone else is just as uncomfortable as you are. If you're alone and someone interrupts you or walks by your desk and tries to gossip, make up an excuse or just shrug. Say you don't know X person well enough to comment, say you've got to go to the rest room, something polite to get them to go away. They'll get the hint and you don't need to get in a big argument over who's a gossip."
172,"What your asking about isn't leadership. It's more about how teams can collaboratively work best together. When I lead projects where this happens, I ask for alternatives, and encourage the debate, while reminding people of the practical limits (e.g. we can't debate forever - we have to deliver something at some point). As the lead, you have to make the final decision, but not alienate people or put them down. I think another, really critical thing that people often forget to do, is follow up after decisions are made. Someone might have had a great idea that didn't get implemented, or an idea that maybe wasn't so good and was never considered - both of those are absolutely okay. If you follow up with the people who put the most energy into the debate (whether or not their ideas were followed), you'll find that they generally care the most about trying to solve problems. If you keep inviting those people back (even if their ideas maybe aren't the greatest), you'll get a much more diverse point of view on new problems in the future, which is way more valuable to creative thinking in an organization than picking the ""winning"" and ""losing"" ideas. You might wonder, ""Well what about the people that put little or no energy into the process?"" I wouldn't worry about that either. Just make sure they know that they're welcome to speak up, and they will when they want and need to."
173,"No I have read a lot of resumes, and never saw a 'career objective' that made me want to call a candidate.  In short, it won't help, and may hurt.  It's your job to find opportunities that match your goals."
174,"Show them all their positives, then explain them the negatives/criticize their work. Then discuss openly and frankly on how to improve those. Show that you're open for discussing issues and never be patronizing (I find that this is the most hurtful). This can apply for other situations, such as giving feedback on negative behaviour."
175,"This is a tough one. I was once a project lead developing a product. We had difficulties with a new member of staff coming on board in accepting that ultimately I was responsible for the decisions on the product. I feel this is an applicable scenario here - I needed to assert leadership to prevent the project from collapsing, but I also needed to focus his technical skills. The employee in question was highly talented, but unfortunately his actions were disrupting to the team. Here's what we tried. Not all of them may be relevant to you, unfortunately: Establishing a review/complete pattern. Previously, we'd allowed this employee to notify us when tasks were done and how they met requirements - however, we subtly altered our approach for this employee, asking him to let us know when he'd finished and then talking through where we were at and whether the results met our objectives. In conjunction to this, we ensured the employee had a chance to be at our direction meetings and understand our requirements. We also had a meeting with the employee, to explain that their talent was a positive thing, but that we had business needs which came first. We also established that the above meetings would take place in this chat, to ensure the employee felt they were still seeing and could comment on the wider picture. We upped our positive feedback. In short, what we did was to set out to establish a slightly more rigorous/formal management chain than was previously in place. Partly, this was self-defence; the employee was altering things against our instructions because they felt I'd make the wrong call and we needed to ensure we reviewed these. However, on the other side, we tried to increase the impression that the employee had a say in decision-making, or at the very least an understanding of why  decisions were made a certain way. We also tried to positively feed back on jobs well done, to show that as a whole hierarchy we were well aware of the employees abilities."
176,"Some of the best leadership experts state that leadership is not about power, it's about service . I can't answer this directly because I feel that the premise is wrong.  I have no reason to believe their behavior should be unwanted.  Maybe they are just trying to help, albeit inappropriately? Maybe the solution is wrong? Here are some tips: If the problem is that team discussions about decisions being made are unproductive due to criticism, start asking questions. Jim Collins, author of Great by Choice and Good to Great , advises to increase your question-to-statement ratio;  Try asking questions twice as often as you make statements.  What are the facts?  Why have we concluded that this decision is best?  This will help you and your team understand the decisions. If you are a good leader, then having other ""leader types"" should be a benefit, not a problem.  Maybe they are just a curmudgeon and you are putting it politely.  However it is, you should be sure you are correctly diagnosing the problem. Leadership is about having power but seldom using it .  You shouldn't need to put them in their place.  They are your team — you should figure out how to build them up."
177,"In my experience, stalling is not the tactic to take--there's always another you out there.  In both job searching and hiring, I've always valued honesty. In the case of the A, B, and laggard C companies you outlined, I would immediately tell Company C that you are already far along the interview process with Companies A & B.  This is not aggressive pushing, but rather immediate honesty -- and what I have found is that if a Company C is really interested in me (or if I'm Company C and I'm really interested in someone), it's amazing how quickly that process can move along... On a similar note, if you feel an offer from Company A or B is imminent , it's reasonable to tell them that you need a few days to consider other offers, which you could use to your advantage with Company C.  I would never force a potential hire to make a decision immediately if I really valued them as a future happy employee, and would respect the need for time to make a decision (within reason -- 3 weeks would be too long). Basically, be honest with everyone involved, even if at the end of the day it means making a hard decision (to pull the plug on something potentially good, in lieu of something actually on the table)."
178,How should I request a copy of my contract?. I don't recall if my contract had a Non-disclosure agreement for my work and I don't seem to have a copy of it in my records. How can I request a copy of my contract from HR without appearing suspicious? What's the standard procedure and is it confidential from other departments? Will it look bad?
179,"The answers here all seem to say ""play it safe and wear the suit"", but I'd like to offer some insight from my experience – from both sides of the table. This advice applies only to technical (developer) interviews.  This is probably bad advice for people in other—especially customer-facing—roles. Like many things in life, the answer is ""it depends.""  I've interviewed with and worked in both large corporate environments and small start-ups.  While it's true that even in large, established companies, dress is becoming less formal, I still wouldn't show up in anything less than a shirt and tie.  If I had the misfortune of interviewing with a very conservative institution (I'm looking at you, banks/finance), a suit is the only way to go. The startup world is entirely different.  I've walked in to an interview in nothing more than a button-down and cotton pants, and the first words out of the interviewer's mouth were, ""oh – you didn't have to get all dressed up just for me.""  While this isn't necessarily a negative, many startups are looking for as much (if not more) of an attitude/ cultural fit as a technical/skillset fit.  Showing up in a stuffy suit to be interviewed by someone in a hoodie might actually work against you – even if subconsciously. I've seen this first-hand at my current (startup) company.  Like anyone else in a mid-market city, we're struggling to find talent, so we brought in a candidate who wasn't the strongest.  He showed up in dress pants, shirt, and a jacket.  While he didn't work out for other reasons (he really didn't have the technical chops nor the cultural fit we're looking for), the one thing that stood out to me was a comment made later: ""his outfit felt like he was trying too hard."" This particular candidate wasn't going to get hired no matter what he wore to the interview, but ""playing it safe"" didn't help either.  Clearly, we're not consciously making decisions based on interview attire (other than ""didn't show up in a mankini"") – that would be a downright silly hiring practice.  However, had his objective technical skills been closer to the bubble, the ""trying too hard"" attitude might have kept the scales tipped in a ""no"" direction based on the purely subjective cultural fit criteria. The bottom line here is you're interviewing for a position where there's often zero customer interaction and sometimes even extremely limited internal (inter-department) interaction.  (Or none, for WFH gigs.)  As long as you're getting the job done , how you present yourself doesn't really matter (within limits, obviously).  The disheveled mess with a beard and glasses who can close 20 issues a day is much more valuable to me than the gentleman with impeccable taste who still doesn't really understand the difference between HTML and (shudder) PHP. So do you show up in jeans and a t-shirt?  Probably not, unless you know everyone else does, and that they'd be OK with it.  A suit?  Only if you know (or have reason to suspect) that not doing so would be a detriment.  In most cases, there's a happy medium to find."
180,"Just ask. You're not obligated to tell them why you need another copy of the contract you signed, and even if an HR person is ""suspicious"" of why you are asking, you do have an answer: you want to fact-check something you signed your name to -- that's a good thing, both for you and for them (you want to make sure you're in compliance ). As for confidentiality, assume everything having to do with employment is confidential.  Even if it isn't, just assume it is unless and until HR explicitly tells you otherwise."
181,"It's frustrating having a boss who doesn't give either positive or negative feedback. My first boss after college was the same way and he made me very nervous because I literally had no idea what he thought. I was too shy then to say anything, but I suggest the best thing you can do for yourself is to speak up and ask him if you are doing OK.  I have seen people get fired for bad performance who thought they were doing OK because no one said anything until the day they got fired.  So first make an appointment with him and discuss, what you are doing well, what needs improvement and create an improvement plan if need be. Finding out for sure if you are doing OK is far more important than getting positive reinforcement. You have to own your own career. No one else will automatically give you feedback unless you ask for it.  If you compete for an internal promotion and don't get selected, ask the hiring offical what you need to to do to be selected for the next one. It's painful to ask for honest feedback because people aren't going to tell you that you are perfect. But the only way to fix problems is to know they exist and asking to know indicates to your boss that you are serious about your career and want to improve beyond the entry level. I don't believe that your boss has no time for positive feedback (It literally takes seconds to give it). What he more likely has is a tendency to not think feedback is important. You may not be able to change his basic personality and if so you may want to think about moving on after a year or two at this place and look for a boss who is more communicative. Look at his behavior with others. Does he give positive or negative reiforcement to them? He may be the type who expects good performance and will only say anything if you don't met his expectations. If this is the case, then you are probaly doing OK when you don't have him yelling at you. One thing about the work world though is that very few bosses give lots of positive reinforcement. So if all you want is postive feedback be prepared to be disappointed. Positive feedback is nice and we all like it, but honestly it doesn't help you improve and grow much, so the other, more painful kind is a far better thing to be looking for especially early in your career. Since you own your career and you want lots of positive feedback, you can ask for it directly, you can ask others to tell your boss when they tell you they did well (the positive reinforcement is actually better to send to your boss to improve his impression of you) or you can keep track of your progress yourself and become internally motivitated to improve without waiting for praise. You can also do things that will get you noticed in a positive way. Make a bargain with yourself that you will be so good that the boss will have to acknowledge it. That means meeting deadlines, having fewer bugs, getting domain knowledge and going one step beyond your peers to get the job done. Once you become known as the go-to person, the people coming to you for advice or help will fulfill your need for postive reinforcement even if they don't specifically tell you what a wonderful fellow you are.  Knowing that they have professional respect for you and that you are trusted to do the hard stuff and to advise others is a positive. But you don't get there easily, or early in your career, you have to build your performance up to that and you do it by seeking out the negative reinfocrement so that you can pull your performance up to the highest level. Once you know you are performing at that level, the need for nice words from others is diminished because you are confident in your own talents and abilities."
182,"Concentrate on the work not the person. That said, it is very hard to get right. What you want is the person to change their behaviour in some way so concentrate on that, explaining why the existing behaviour is a problem and what can be done to improve that. This should (hopefully) create some emotional distance between the person and the problem so that they can see that it's not personal and help them concentrate on the solution."
183,"Does the first person to mention a number in a salary negotiation lose?. When talking about salary negotiation (or any negotiation), it's become somewhat conventional wisdom that ""the first to give a number loses"" . Steve Hanov says so . So does Knocks.com . Is this true? Here are some special cases that may call this advice into question: What about large employers who have the power to absolutely require all candidates to reveal detailed salary history? How do you avoid wasting everyone's time by being completely out of range of what the company is willing to pay? Isn't it possible to ""lose"" more by seeming difficult to work with than to simply ask for a generous salary right at the beginning of the discussion (when the recruiter/hiring manager brings it up, of course)?"
184,"The software industry includes businesses for development, maintenance and publication of software that are using any business model. The industry also includes software services, such as training, documentation, and consulting."
185,"Questions with this tag should be specific to the Software Industry, or to workplace elements commonly associated with said industry. The Software Industry deals with the creation, maintenance, and distribution of software.  In addition, the creation of any associated training/documentation, as well as any consulting work, is included under the auspices of Software Industry."
186,"Setting an example is not the only way, but it is the easiest way. Nobody is going to follow somebody that doesn't know what the heck they're talking about. They're going to follow those who take initiative and are respectable people. By doing this, you won't lose any job security, and you will most likely gain it. You could also gradually move into the role... I actually like this scenario. For example, if you were to start helping a single employee with their work, others will see that. They will then begin asking for help, and gradually, you could become a leader in your workplace without anybody even realizing it. Or you could be an evil dictator... Yeah. Don't do that."
187,"I think that the answer is that you can but that it doesn't matter much. I usually ignore this section when I see it on a resume because it's the easiest part to fake in order to mirror what you know about the job and company you're applying to. Your experience and perhaps a longer cover letter explaining how your experience (and objectives) fit with the company are a lot more important. At the very least, I don't think that the career objective section hurts in any way."
188,"When someone is not doing well, the best thing you can do for them is to tell them what is wrong and what needs to be fixed. Don't fix things behind their back (they will never know that what they do is unacceptable), don't pretend everything is fine. Be honest about the problem, ask them for solutions but point them to the solution you want if need be. You don't need to be nasty or personally attack them, but you need to set clear expectations of what is acceptable and what is not. I once had two employees and I promoted one and did not promote the other and I had to sit down with her and tell her exactly what she needed to do to get that promotion. She had a specific list of things that needed improvement and that she had to show me she could accomplish before being a senior person. She eventually got that promotion becasue she knew what standard she had to meet and that I would promote her as soon as she had met that standard. Those conversations are hard, they aren't fun for the manager, but you can't manage well unless you are willing to have those conversations. In the software development world, code reviews are a good place to start. You aren't attacking the person, just seeing what the code does and how it can be improved. Getting the developers to not think they own the code and no one else should see it or touch it, is also a part of code review making it even more important to do in any software shop. And don't just review the poorer performers, if everyone has code reviewed, then the criticisms will be taken better. In the non-software world, you can also take the time to do checks of someone's work on a regular basis especially if the person is new or very junior. It is easier to catch a problem in the first weeks they work for you, than to get upset over a long-standing problem after they have been doing it that way for a year and you never said anything. Give positive feedback when warranted. If you see improvement in a specific area of concern, make sure the person knows you noticed. And be fair.  Don't reserve all your praise for one person and all your criticism for another. And don't criticize publically. Praise is given in public, but criticism is given in private."
189,"The basic theory behind ""the first to give a number loses,"" from the job seeker's perspective, is that one might be ""leaving money on the table"" by naming a salary request.  This viewpoint has a deeper root, however, in ""positional bargaining,"" in which the two parties' interests are directly opposed and the relationship is adversarial. A strict ""positional bargaining"" strategy, however, is usually not in the best interest of either party to the negotiation.  Instead of worrying about who names the first number, do your homework.  Determine in advance what your interests are and what you would be willing to accept.  The overall package (including benefits, location, type of work, opportunities for advancement, etc.) consists of far more than just salary.  Also consider what is typical for hiring someone of your skill level for the type of work you are doing for the type of company in that geographic area.  I know that is a lot to consider, but if you do your research, you should be able to arrive at some conclusions. At that point, you can be prepared for the salary negotiation without worrying about who names the first number.  If you are at the point of salary negotiation, the company already wants to hire you.  Get on the same side of the metaphorical table -- you are not adversaries!  You are pursuing a mutually beneficial relationship.  Talk about what is fair instead of simply making salary demands.  If you can do this effectively, you can show that you are easy to work with while still maintaining your interests.  Further, you make the discussion about the issues, not the people, so no one gets offended. While I find it aggravating that some companies ask for salary history (which is often irrelevant to what is fair, given what I just stated), if you have to give it, do so.  It really does not change the negotiation if you get on the same side of the table.  If the employer is unwilling to negotiate in this manner, you may wish to reconsider whether you want to work for that employer anyway. I realize this answer may be vague, but I'm trying to make the point that, with negotiation based on interests rather than positions, naming numbers becomes far less relevant."
190,"When you are looking for motivation you have to make one thing clear in your mind: why are you doing this? If you are developing the idea just for kicks nothing in the world will motivate you to do it when you can have fun. So basically all you need to repeat to yourself is : in 3,4,5,6 months when I finish with my idea I will be able to give my boss the bird, quit and work the hours I want on something I like to do. Having a family that supports your endeavor also helps. Although finding a spouse that understands the long term goals is a challenge but is a great motivator."
191,"Some things to try: Distance yourself from the work you do at your job. You can keep it relevant, but change it up enough that you're not doing the same thing seven days a week. Keep lists of goals and tasks for your project. It's a lot easier to get going if you limit yourself to one small task at a time. Schedule out time to work on projects. A definite schedule is harder to ignore than a vague notion that you might have some time this weekend to spend on your project. Make sure you enjoy what you're working on. If you view it as more work, it's going to be difficult to get started. Plus you'll burn out eventually. Get other people involved. If you commit to working with others, you'll be much less likely to back out."
192,"Not necessarily. I think you can shoot for the stars and ask for more than even you think you deserve (within reason.. maybe 10 or 20k more than you would accept). In that case, you can wind up winning even when you've named first. It's also possible that a company will offer a number you can't accept and that they can't go above for budget reasons, in which case you both lose. Special cases: If you need to list your salary history you haven't necessarily
lost. If you can justify a step up from your last position, a
company may be willing to consider it. I would say (having done some
recruiting) that you should try your best not to provide this
information. It is rarely disqualifying if you don't provide it
(unless not providing it prevents you from even completing an online
application form). You can give wide ball-park ranges to a company to see if you're in
    the right neighborhood of what they can pay. Based on job
    description alone you should be able to guess what sort of level a
    position is. The number of times you'll be completely wrong about
    the level of a job having seen the description will be far fewer
    than the number of times you're right. I would say it's actually a great strategy to shoot high and then accept a little lower. It makes you seem easy to work with, yes, but more importantly it makes you seem like you know what you want and what you're worth. You can't be too concerned about wasting time on an interview that turns out to be for a job that's way below your range. It won't happen often. More importantly though, don't accept less than you want and count on earning more after reviews/promotions. It almost never works out well unless you have a formal review written into a contract with an agreed-upon raise if the review is favorable."
193,"This can be tricky because it's so easy to make things worse than if you hadn't written one at all. So, I'd build on Scott Wilson's answer : the company cares about what they want , and how you'll provide that, not what they'll be providing you: Think of an objective as a mission statement for the relationship between you and the employer . That way, your objective that tells them exactly what they'll get out of it. The EntreLeadership podcast had an episode about personal mission statements with Dan Miller, author of 48 Days to the Work you Love .  It says that a mission statement should be brief and tell you the what , the how , and the why . Here's mine, for reference: To provide expertise in software creation — design, architecture, and management. Roughly, Why: To create software How: Expertise What: Design, architecture and management"
194,"I find that one of the most important factors in becoming a leader on a team, unofficially or officially, is maintaining a positive and communicative relationship with every member of the team. Part of a lead's job is to help every member of the team do well at their job -  not just the ones they get along with naturally. You don't have to be buddies with everybody on the team, but everyone should think of you as someone with a fair perspective and someone who respects everyone on the team, even if they'd never want to talk to you outside of work. This will help you gradually move into the role, as Jae mentioned. If you have some kind of relationship with each team member in which they regard you as helpful (or at least respectfully interested), you can start to become the natural choice. This answer reminds us that leadership isn't about power, it's about service . Your job in forging these relationships is therefore not to nitpick or provide unwanted instructions on how to proceed on a particular project or task. It's to try to provide any help that the team member might require to do their job better, even if sometimes that means simply going out to get them a cup of coffee if it will help them meet a deadline. A leader should put the needs of their team - both the individuals and the team as a unit - before their own needs. Start doing this, and the title (or at least the unofficial role) will follow."
195,"How should I bring up working from home?. Working from home is becoming more and more common. If my work lends itself to remoteness, what's a good way to ask management to work from home from time to time? Or is this not a reasonable thing to expect? I don't necessarily want to work remotely on a recurring basis (e.g. every Monday) but answers addressing that situation are also welcome."
196,"Frame it in a way that would benefit the company. If your current work environment is loud, annoying, with too many distractions, etc, then consider telling your boss (truthfully) that you could work more productively from home one or two days per week. You might also mention that your lack of commute on those days would also give you some extra time to work."
197,"How to avoid or reverse getting ""burned out"" on a project. I have been with my current employer for about nine months.  Due to what I believe are project planning issues that occurred prior to my employment here, the project I joined in-progress, which was scheduled for completion by last October, is still ongoing with no sign of ending.  The project is important to the company, and I realize it is my job to help bring it to completion.  Honestly, though, I'm tired of the project (as is everyone involved, I think), and try as I might to be professional, I think my ""burn-out"" is making me less productive than I would like.  How can I alleviate this burn-out when there is no light at the end of the tunnel?"
198,"Be prepared to give some tangible benefits and also reassurance that the work is getting done. If you show that you are willing to be flexible in the requirements of the ""work from home"" structure and you are fine with it, then your manager will be more indifferent to your work environment. For example, you may need to work in a new reporting structure to show that work is getting done, and provide metrics that your work output is either equivalent or improved by you working at home. If there is extra overhead for you to work from home you will most likely need to show that there is a increased benefit to productivity in this venture. From my personal experience, I was required to spend an extra 10 minutes every day preparing a report on my tasks completed for that day - something that was not expected while working in the office. This was a auditing policy."
199,"What are possible career transitions for a seasoned software developer?. I have been a software developer for 11 years. During these years I worked for number of companies, sometimes changing places twice or three times a year. They say it takes 10 years to reach 'expert' level, and while I don't think I am an expert by any measure and I have certainly met lots of people who are more knowledgeable, smarter and more focused than I am, however I think it is safe to say that I had my fair share of the whole programming thing and would like to move into something else. I still get the thrill when a piece of code I've been working on finally starts doing what it supposed to do and things fall into places; I still like discovering new techniques and learning new technologies, although it has got kind of repetitive - I can already see the patterns in this process. It was fun to crack open new things like python, node.js, html5 etc. but after some time it has lost some of its appeal. Psychology and people's behaviour has always been something interesting for me, especially the practical, applicable bits. Recently I've been to some communication skills training and I realised that I have been missing out on the great deal of fun stuff - how people work and communicate, especially in subconscious, non-verbal area. I also find fields of Design, typography and UX to be quite interesting, maybe because they are deeply rooted in human psychology and have to take into account various behavioural quirks. Currently I am thinking of making a career change - ideally moving somewhere my technical skills would still be beneficial in some shape or form. Obviously I have some financial commitments already and would prefer a rather gradual transition. What are the steps I can take to figure out what I really like and what can make an interesting career going further?"
201,"Even once the technical stuff is no longer the challenge, people will always remain a challenge. Learning to communicate technical concepts to non technical people is a rewarding endeavor. That can mean management, pre sales engineering, or a whole host of stuff. Ultimately, computers are easy because they will always do what you tell them. People are not - so if you can learn to interface between the two, you'll never get bored (frustrated, maybe.  Psychotic, possibly, but bored, never. ) Being able to bridge the two is a career."
202,"Start with, ""hey, boss. Tomorrow, I need to get X, Y, And Z done. If I'm here, the distractions of the office will probably limit me to X and Y, but if you let me work from home, I bet I could get Z done too."" Repeat often enough to gain your boss's trust, then see about making it a regular thing. Have verifiable, set targets, identify an obstacle in the workplace, and have a record of meeting the targets at home, and you'll be on your way to working in your pajamas."
204,"How many simultaneous job applications is too many?. When I last applied for a job, I sent out as many applications as I could. Granted, this wasn't a lot, maybe 50 applications in three weeks. I've heard of others sending out hundreds at a time. But others suggest that you don't need to apply to more than three or four places at once. What are the pros and cons of sending out lots of applications, assuming you take the time to write different cover letters and tune your résumé each time?"
205,"For a software developer there are a number of paths you can go in your career. Management, which is further divided into People Management Project Management Top-most level of software engineer/architect.  See this relevant discussion Breaking off into independent consulting. Doing a start-up or small business Academia Based on your question, I think the latter 2 choices might be what you're looking for.  It seems you're interested in Human-Computer Interaction, and that is something you can explore in a Master's Degree or PhD. Otherwise, you're describing a position that dons a few hats: technical/developer skills, design, communication.  That type of position you would only find if you joined a startup (where you're oftentimes expected to wear more than one hat) or started your own thing. I'd recommend the book Quitter .  It will ""help bridge the gap between your day job and dream job"". :)"
207,"How should I approach my boss about a raise/promotion?. What is the best manner to approach a supervisor and request a raise or promotion? As a web developer, it's not really easy to quantify performance standards on any type of metrics either."
208,"It might be time for a rebirth, or a ""come to Jesus"" meeting, as a CTO I worked for would say. The facts The project is behind schedule The project still needs to be completed You suspect... Others are burned out too The project planning was/is mismanaged. What can be done? The project is already behind and everyone is still chugging away with no change. This is a classic scenario for bad decisions to be made (imagine a basketball game where you are down by a lot — it's easy to just start throwing up three pointers which have no more chance of success than they did before), and since the project is behind you know something went wrong somewhere. The time that you are behind is a sunk cost and as much as everyone feels the urgency to keep their heads down, with no time for planning, recuperation, or organization — those things are still the best way to make the project a success going forward. Otherwise, you will surely experience diminishing returns as the way you are working is not sustainable . So, I would bring the facts, your suspicions, and a proposal to your manager. Tell your manager you think this is the best way to make the project successful. The team needs to get together and have a meeting to discuss the following things: What is left to be done Is anything off-track beyond saving Does any realignment of strategy or planning need to happen on the remaining work? Pick a new deadline . How long realistically will the remaining work take? Re-estimate it however your group works, with an emphasis on worst-case. Remember Hofstadter's Law : It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law Are the current daily and weekly processes and work schedules going to be effective and sustainable for the time remaining? Can any general team-health efforts (brainstorming meetings, book clubs, team lunches, encouraging/scheduling vacations for individual team members) increase the ability of the team to execute against the newly-planned deadline? As you or your manager bring up these issues, if your suspicions are correct, other team members will begin to express their concerns as well. You're going to have to figure out what's gone wrong and it's easier to do that all at once. Hopefully you can all walk away with a renewed sense of purpose, productivity, and sustainability. That's the best way I know to fight project burn-out."
209,"How important is a grade point average on a resume?. I admit i wasn't the best student in college. My years in college were spent working at a job. How important is it to include my grade point average on a resume? Also, at what point should i stop including it? I'm about 5/6 years removed of college and been working in the field extensively."
210,"How can I politely leave meetings I can't contribute to or learn from?. At my job we have fairly frequent meetings with either ill-defined agendas, or agendas that are a long list of subjects with no central theme - basically ""the team should meet to talk about anything anyone feels should be brought up"" meetings, with or without everyone emailing a list of what they want to talk about in advance. (I'm not in charge of organizing them, although I could suggest a different model if anyone has a good alternative.) At some meetings, there turns out to be nothing that's relevant to my part of the job, or else we go over most of the points of the list quickly and then end up spending half an hour on something I can't contribute to. (Most of the team does hands-on science, I just do the data analysis). Is there any polite way for me to excuse myself from the meeting when it becomes clear there is no reason for me to be there? Or would it be a bad idea to try at all?"
211,"As a person who has hired a lot of people, In almost all cases I would say a firm NO . I've never seen an objective statement that helped sell a candidate to me, and I've seen lots that did the opposite. Also, consider that you have a limited attention span before the reader moves on to the next person. Are you really going to waste space at the very top of your resume with throwaway information? If you absolutely must include it, put it at the very bottom. I suggest replacing it with a very succinct bulleted list of your best selling points."
212,"First and foremost, be honest with yourself. I would say evaluate yourself and determine your worth in the company. If you feel that you need a raise, be honest with your employer. Explain to them what you are looking for (raise or promotion) and I would not expect to get an answer right away. Just drop a bug in their ear and if they request to think about it for a week or two, let them. If this time goes by and you still do not hear anything from them, schedule a meeting with them and bring it up again. Go into the meeting knowing what you would like to get and what you are willing to go with for now."
213,"I've was once unemployed for several months. If you have free time on your hands like i did. I didn't ever limit the amount of applications i would apply for. I would even apply at positions i was underqualified for. You never really know. I would track where you've applied in a spreadsheet or calendar if you could. It couldn't be more embarrassing applying at the same advertisement more than once. It could be seen as unprofessional. I would also suggest that you automate the process. Write the necessary details: industry specific cover letter, industry specific  resume, and a follow up email template if you can. Also, applying for jobs is a skill one must practice at. This ability is very valuable in itself."
214,"Here's a pretty good test for questions of the format: ""Is it ethical/professional to _ ?"" The answer is almost always the same as this question: ""Would you feel uncomfortable telling your boss about _ ?"""
215,"Since you have worked in the field extensively, I believe putting your GPA is not needed at all: after all, you have already proven your skills - despite not having been the best student. Most employers do know that good grades do not translate to actual experience (and in fact can mean the opposite, sometimes)."
216,"I would advise you to discuss it in private with your manager (or with whoever is organizing the meetings if it isn't your manager). Let them know how you feel, but try not to insult them. If they're worth their salt they should value your time and try to make a plan accordingly - either by altering the structure of the meetings or by arranging some way to let non-hands-on-science people leave the room when the meeting moves in that direction. If your manager isn't receptive, you could try discussing it with your teammates. Who tends to derail the conversation into off-topic stuff? Would you feel comfortable asking them to try to wait until they're meeting only with the hands-on science people to bring up those topics? In general, I simply recommend being honest (but constructively so) with anyone who could change the situation for you - and doing it in private, so nobody feels attacked in front of their peers."
217,"I would just say to stay in the meeting,  You may not know why you were asked to be there in the first place. After all most meetings will only take an hour. If you really feel that you need to not be in the meeting, and are in a good place in your job and company, you could always explain to the meeting organizer or the person who asked you to be there that it may not be the best use of your time.  If you are already in the meeting before you realize this you could always wait for a good break point of the meeting and excuse yourself and just state that you feel that the meeting is not the best use of your time."
218,"As a hiring manager, I'd suggest not including your GPA unless it was exceptional or the employer specifically asks for it. As for as how much it matters: If I am reading a resume with no job experience it is almost all I have to go on. Still, I wouldn't include it unless it helps sell you. Many managers won't ask and you don't want to volunteer unsolicited information that hurts your case. Never once have I looked at a resume that omitted a GPA and ruled it out because of that. In fact 90% of the resumes I read don't include them. If I had concerns I'd just ask you at the interview. Once you have some job experience on your resume, I don't care anymore. What you did in college is far less important than what you did in a real job similar to the one I am hiring for."
219,"In general, this is all going to depend on who's at the meeting and how easily they might be offended. I would say a better solution would be to talk to the meeting organizers. Ask them to consider using an agenda noting that It will likely make everyone more productive, knowing what needs to be covered ahead of time You'll have a history of what was covered for future reference At the same time, you can ask them to organize the meetings so that you do your part and let others do theirs. If you have an agenda that clearly states nothing of relevance to you, it doesn't seem rude to step out at that point."
220,"Rather than a large number of scatter shot applications, I'd rather see you focus deeply on a small number and personalize each one, explaining why you'd like to work for their company and why you're a good match for their needs.  A letter that shows that you took the time to research the company puts you heads and shoulders above someone who sends a generic cover letter. Think quality not quantity."
221,"Given that you really consider there's no gain in being there, here's my suggestion: Try sitting next to your boss. When the meeting gets to its most pointless, quietly turn to your boss and say ""hey, I have to deliver X today, I will make it, but I need the time. You think I can sneak out to get this done?"". The boss will not say no if you do it in the perfect time. Depending on the pointlessness of the meeting, he/she will probably wish to go with you. Now, if YOUR BOSS called the meeting, you're out of luck. Attend and try not to fall asleep."
222,"For highly competitive jobs, it's expected that you'll customize your resume, cover letter, and initial contact to the employer to which you're applying. When acting as a hiring manager, you can smell a no-effort application attempt a mile away, and it's a waste of your time (the person applying, and the person reading the application). On jobs that are more entry-level and ""first job"" types, like your first job as a waiter, food service, sales clerk, etc., this is less important, but will still show effort. When a person is unemployed, I agree you should spend the time wisely. Casting your net wide is not as effective, however, as targeting places you want to work. If you don't have a specific place in mind, it's a much more effective use of your time to either go to job fairs (and make a personal, face-to-face impression with a potential employer), or register with a temp agency and get side jobs while still having plenty of time to apply to permanent positions."
223,"Less and less important as your career experience grows.  And while you're new with a short resume, if you weren't a superstar student, talk about what else you did during school - did you work part time, grade papers, tutor, play sports, etc."
225,"**Be upfront and honest and ask: Am I still needed here? ** Then re-acknowledge the items that have been assigned to you during the meeting  before leaving.. I'll have that report ready for you by the end of the day Of course this is under the assumption that you KNOW you are not needed, and everyone else will agree. (IE your manager didn't ask you sit in and take notes)"
226,"Is there any evidence that giving references for former employees is inherently risky?. I've noticed a trend that most HR departments discourage or even have policies against giving references for former employees that go beyond these basic questions: Confirm Employment Verify dates and job title Are they eligible for rehire? The explanation I am always given is that if the reference I give is positive the new company could sue because I oversold the employee, and if I give a negative reference the former employee could sue because I somehow defamed them. Talking to other managers, this position seems to be pretty standard. However, I feel strongly that the risks are minimal and not giving a reference for a former employee actually has more potential for harm because that person is an ambassador who, outside of your control, will spread the word about your workplace to other people who are likely in the pool of candidates you will want to recruit one day. For me, it is vitally important that employees leave the company with as positive impression of the place as possible. So the question is this, am I wrong about this? Has there been a lot of litigation in the past that I'm not aware of either from former employees or new employers related to references being given? Also, are there other reasons that giving references is verboten by many HR departments?"
227,"When I taught undergrads how to create their resumes, we spent an entire class period talking about the inclusion of GPA on a resume, and when and why it might be necessary.  In short, the students all recognized that as juniors or seniors (3rd or 4th year) preparing for summer internships and first jobs out of school, that sometimes their GPA was all that would set them apart from their peers.  In some cases, this GPA would set people apart...poorly...so some suggestions for mitigating this poor overall GPA included: showing GPA in the major field -- especially useful for the international students who made up most of my classes) who were
multilingual learners and tended to perform less well in reading and
writing intensive general education courses than they did in core
courses in Finance, MIS, Engineering and the like. listing specific coursework completed in the major -- some students reported great success delineating the progression and depth
of courses completed rather than ""3.1/4.0"" with no indication of what
that B average was in . But after that discussion, I said that the minute they get that first job, take it off the resume. Once you have one job, any job, in the field in which you are trained or intend to make your career path (at least for the near term), what you did in that job is what will get you in the door to the next one -- not the GPA. In your specific situation, take it off immediately and never think about it again."
229,"What are methods for conducting efficient meetings?. What are some methods of coordinating meaningful effective meetings? Effective is defined as succinct, following the scope, leaving with decisions made, etc. Of all the meetings we conduct as a company, it seems as they are inefficient and lack direction. Our meetings recently have been about process management and following up with our goals as a company: increasing billable hours, making web development more profitable, etc. And of course our meetings are ironically titled, effeciency meetings."
230,"This employee has a tendency to interrupt my training of other
  employees/my conversations with our mutual superiors in a way that I
  think negatively impacts establishing myself in this position. Address this directly, be respectful but firm. let him know he simply cannot do this. Be sure he understands that you are the middle man between him and Sr. Management. Again be respectful but firm. Then get out of his way so he can do his job, Let him know you are there to get him whatever he need to do his job. Take an interest in his work, and acknowledge his accomplishments."
232,"What does ""years of professional experience"" entail or refer to?. Oftentimes on a job application for a more specialized position, you'll see a box for ""years of professional experience."" What all does this entail? Is it simply how many years you've worked in a job that is exactly like this job, or very similar? For example, if I was applying for a security job, would volunteer experience with a local police department be considered professional experience? What about simple supervisor experience at a grocery store? Does the word ""professional"" become strict to having had a profession, getting paid for it? Also, where is the cut-off line for what year you should round too? For example, if I've had 11 months of experience in something, I'd probably round it off to a year. If I has one year and a month, I'd probably say I have one year experience. What if I had one year and six months experience? What if I only had 4 months experience? Should I round up to a year or just say I don't have any experience and hope they ask at an interview?"
233,"Set a clear goal, and accomplish it. If the meeting goes long because you find that more discussion is needed, then schedule a follow up. If you find that your meeting goals aren't being met, then find out why and fix it. If you find the reason to be because the meeting isn't about anything important, then cancel the meeting. You'd be surprised how many people would hear this approach and say, ""But, we've always had this meeting. Can we do that?!"" Look for more effective ways to get things done than through meetings (can you have conversations with decision makers directly, without excluding important voices from the decision; can you send information through email instead of stopping work and bringing everyone together just to spread information)? The more pomp and circumstance you have around meetings, the more likely it is that they've become about worshiping at The Alter of the Meeting (and the people running the meeting) than getting meaningful work done. Like anything, a meeting should be chosen as the form of communication and collaboration because it's the best tool for a given job, the same way you would choose a solution to a business problem, not because meetings are ""what we do"". Here's also a list of 5 practical alternatives to having meetings that can often accomplish the purpose of meetings without having to use up as much organizational time and people."
234,"Should I encourage my coworkers to share their salaries with each other?. Objectively speaking, the only party that would not benefit from everyone knowing what everybody else earns (specially people in similar positions) is the employer. Yet, there's a stigma about it. Knowing that someone earns more than you may generate jealousy, but on the other hand, it could give you arguments when asking for a raise. What are the pros and cons about knowing what my co-workers earn? Would it negatively affect the work environment? Are there benefits or should I just accept that someone was a better negotiator than me signing in and not worry about it?"
235,"Is there evidence to suggest that certain office layouts are better than others for productivity?. Joel Spolsky is pretty famous for advocating private offices for workers, particularly software developers (see here , here or here for example). I've also read that Microsoft generally has private offices, and I've interviewed at at least one company which also claimed private offices were better for productivity. I'm curious what research has been done to support these claims, if any. Further, is there a ""second best"" layout? For example, are cubicles better than a completely open floor plan? Since much of my work involves team interaction, I'm looking for data that addresses both individual and team productivity, if possible."
236,"Feed into it! Gossip is just another word for ""information exchange"". It only becomes a problem when it's harmful or incorrect. Folks naturally want to share information about each other and the company they work for, and trying to suppress it is futile; indeed, if you develop a reputation for shutting down gossip, you may find yourself ""out of the loop"" as your co-workers learn to recognize you as a buzz-kill. And by refusing to join in, you may actually be hurting yourself and others : The study also found that gossip can be therapeutic. Volunteers’ heart rates increased when they witnessed someone behaving badly, but this increase was tempered when they were able to pass on the information to alert others. “Spreading information about the person whom they had seen behave badly tended to make people feel better, quieting the frustration that drove their gossip,” Willer said. So don't just listen. Participate! And make sure you're sharing helpful and accurate information, and encouraging others to do likewise. ...Or failing that, at least spread entertaining misinformation: Mary : Did you hear about Janice? Her son got arrested for selling Ritalin at school! Lucas : No, I didn't... But what a relief it is to hear she actually has a son! There was a rumor going around that her whole family was just a cover story, to hide her involvement in the Russian mafia!"
238,"So the question is this, am I wrong about this? Has there been a lot of litigation in the past that I'm not aware of either from former employees or new employers related to references being given? Also, are there other reasons that giving references is verboten by many HR departments? Yes , here's why: If HR is contacted, then the HR response is an official response of the company, not some individual's honest opinion. So it must be nothing but factual things about the employee (this is why the company is libel to be sued by the employee). Also I'd to add that: Anyone who gives an HR reference is off his rocker! What does HR know about him/her? If someone told me to contact his former firm's HR as opposed to a boss or coworker that would be a HUGE red flag to not hire that individual."
239,"Unless they ask for months and years, I think you're fine rounding 11 months up to 1 year. Don't round 7 months up to a year though - that's a bit of a stretch. I think the distinction of ""professional"" experience is important, because being paid to do a job implies that you did a good enough job that someone paid you to do it (and were, presumably, satisfied with your work often enough to keep paying you). If you have years of volunteer experience, I think that's fantastic. Include that - it often helps, and depending on where you're applying, this might be a big plus. However, it should not be considered professional experience. For example, as a young Boy Scout, and as an adult, I worked for years painting houses, re-shingling roofs, doing yard work, cleaning city streets, and other service/volunteer work. That's good, and to an employer it would show my willingness to ""go the extra mile,"" and to do things that just need to get done (and not just because I'm getting paid). However , does that make me qualified to be professional painter (that you would pay money for), a roofer (that you'd pay money for), or a professional landscaper (that you'd pay money for)? Does it make me qualified to mentor or supervise a professional in any of those industies? No, I'm afraid it doesn't."
240,"I would avoid asking general question of your overall performance outside a formal review, it will just make you sound insecure. Rather ask for feedback on specific tasks you performed.. Hay, Boss, any comments on the new splash page I put together for you?
  Any Changes? This way is doesn't look like you are fishing for compliments, but that you are just insuring that everything is up to his standard for his benefit"
244,"The best thing I know to make a meeting better is to create, publish, and stick to an agenda. A clearly written agenda, which includes the goal or goals of the meeting, makes sure the person running the meeting has invested the time needed to prepare fort he meeting. It also lets everybody know what is supposed to take place. It can even simplify the taking of notes, because you are mostly recording action items and decisions."
246,"Why to do it: Transparency of things like salaries generally lead to more fairness. It also forces employers to base salaries on more objective (and open) justifications for setting salaries, as opposed to who the best negotiator is, nepotism, or other potentially corrosive practices. This can work best in environments where performance is highly objective vs. subjective. For example, my very first job, Taco Bell, would pay a certain bonus if you could pass a test that proved that you had food ingredients and amounts memorized. The reason is because a high percentage of how efficient a particular restaurant location was had to do with how quickly and accurately the employees could produce food, to order, the same way every time. In this case, it's clear what the incentive is for both the employer and the employee, and therefore under what conditions it was easy for a boss to give me an ""automatic"" pay bump due to efficiency gain. In places where performance is more subjective, simply having a process for how salaries are determined, and having that process be open to discussion to some level, can contribute to a feeling of fairness. Organizations that operate as cooperatives (where the employees also own the company) are examples of where everyone's incentives are aligned, generally, can handle this well. Going too far with an approach that focuses on measurements is that you can fall into the trap of reducing everything to performance numbers, which are only motivating to some employees, to the exclusion of others. An approach such as this also tends to focus on efficiency instead of other factors that may be valuable to the company and its employees, such as culture, design, customer satisfaction, etc. Fairness is what is important, regardless of what the right approach is in the specific case. If you focus on fairness, then you can't worry too much about jealousy. You might have some people that are jealous, but so long as the path to get from where they are to where they want to be is clear (and it's not an old boys club where the path is clear, but you also have to kiss a lot of ass needlessly), then you can always point jealous employees back to that process. In case I haven't said it already, I don't think there's ever a downside (for the employees) to opening up the process. It can help shed light on unfair practices that may exist, even if the employer isn't trying to be unfair. Regarding fears that it won't work: I've seen transparency work. I think the fear that it's a slippery slope toward every-increasing salaries or complaining employees is just silly: the company can always say ""no"". Transparency in this case tends to fail only if you don't also publish a list of fair, reasonable criteria for setting salaries which can be largely objectively measured. I've also had a personal experience where an employee found out that they were being paid significantly less than another employee who (by the agreement of all their peers and supervisor) did a poorer job, and hadn't been there as long, nor was as productive. The unfortunate response the underpaid employee was given was, ""Well, it's not going to change, so there's nothing to negotiate here."" I only found out about this situation when the supervising manager was later replaced - not because of this situation, but this was one of the things that came in out the process. As a result, the company established a more open process to setting starting and advancing salaries. While individual salaries were still never revealed, managers made sure that they had ""real"" reasons for paying people what they did, so that when employees did discuss their salaries (which is pretty much inevitable), and asked questions of their supervisor, they were able to discuss the standards for setting salaries, and direct action the employee could take to increase their salary , which pretty much solved these problems. One, very public (and one private) example of this working: StackExchange itself publishes its compensation determination strategy (Dec. 2015 update - this link is broken, but here's a sort-of close equivalent) . I'm not trying to tout StackExchange just because we're using their services, they're simply one of the best examples of ways to run a company more openly, and they actually make the compensation strategy public for the entire world to see. Ternary Software (now closed, but the spiritual predecessor to Holocracy One ) also had an open salary strategy. Everyone knew everyone else's salary and the criteria that went into it, but things didn't start this way. In fact, the persons who enacted a more open system not only made money a non-issue by publishing the criteria for setting salaries, they also lowered their own base salaries, and (based on group agreement) refocused compensation based on what was both good for the company's success, and the employee's long-term growth and motivation. The result was that the group decided what mattered to the life and success of the company, and gave employees a clear direction for increasing their salary if they desired (believe it or not, this isn't always the highest priority for employees). When the employees did bigger and better things, the company also was doing bigger and better things, so it was a no-brainer to give someone a bonus when they clearly, and directly affected the bottom line for the better. Regarding how to do it Now, you did ask about whether or not you should encourage employees to share their salaries. The transition from secrecy to transparency takes time. I would say that going gangbusters and encouraging everyone to switch to transparency tomorrow is likely to turn a few heads and breed confusion - probably not a good idea. You're almost certainly going to hear all the fears that you can imagine about why this won't work. The trick is to take it slow. Different companies (and company cultures) will take different amounts of time to make a transition like this (and if they decide not to make this transition, that might be okay too). So, take it one step at a time. Maybe propose a small change. Maybe talk about exposing the salary slowly and implementing only a handful of changes each quarter. Maybe start with a discussion about how compensation should be determined and start getting ideas. Yes, you will, of course, get the people who say, ""Well, I produce $5,000 in revenue to the company every month, and I therefore should get paid precisely that amount""), but this is unrealistic and impractical on a number of levels, and that's not how businesses work, grow, or improve. People that want to make exactly the money that they bring in should become independent contractors - they can live and die by exactly the amount of money they bring in the door all they want. I think one of the most important things here is that you be just as transparent about how and when you plan to make this transition as you plan on being when you reach transparency. Every company culture will inevitably decide that their comfort level is a little different than other places, and it's okay if they don't end up where you hope they will. These ideas go against a lot of social norms, and it's going to take time to make whatever transition an organization decides to take on. One completely different way to do this might be to simply announce a bonus for some performance metric, let other people propose additional, incremental changes in conjunction with the business owners, and let the momentum of this process guide it."
248,"Probably this is not what you are looking for since that's not a research but an anecdotal evidence. Yet I found it to be much easier to focus on complex and time-consuming tasks when sitting in a quiet room alone or with just a couple of other programmers. My productivity drops sharply when people around are talking on the phone, having meetings, smalltalks etc - I have to actively screen that out by trying to ignore it, and subjectively that wastes a lot of ""mental energy"". I also noticed that I tend to burn out way faster in noisy environments as well as procrastinate more (switching to internet browsing, social web etc)."
250,"Jeff Atwood drafts a few simple guidelines, in a recent blog post : No meeting should ever be more than an hour, under penalty of death. The first and most important constraint on any meeting is the most precious imaginable resource at any company: time. If you can't fit your meeting in about an hour, there is something deeply wrong with it, and you should fix that first. Either it involves too many people, the scope of the meeting is too broad, or there's a general lack of focus necessary to keep the meeting on track. I challenge anyone to remember anything that happens in a multi-hour meeting. When all else fails, please keep it short! Every meeting should have a clearly defined mission statement. What's the mission statement of your meeting? Can you define the purpose of your meeting in a single succinct sentence? I hesitate to recommend having an ""agenda"" and ""agenda items"" because the word agenda implies a giant, tedious bulleted list of things to cover. Just make sure the purpose of the meeting is clear to everyone; the rest will take care of itself. Do your homework before the meeting. Since your meeting has a clearly defined mission statement, everyone attending the meeting knows in advance what they need to talk about and share, and has it ready to go before they walk into the room. Right? That's how we can keep the meeting down to an hour. If you haven't done your homework, you shouldn't be in the meeting. If nobody has done their homework, the meeting should be cancelled. Make it optional. ""Mandatory"" meetings are a cop-out. Everyone in the meeting should be there because they want to be there, or they need to be there. One sure way to keep yourself accountable for a meeting is to make everyone optional. Imagine holding a meeting that people actually wanted to attend, because it was … useful. Or interesting. Or entertaining. Now make it happen! Summarize to-dos at the end of the meeting. If your meeting never happened, what would the consequences be? If the honest answer to that is almost nothing, then perhaps your meeting has no reason to exist. Any truly productive meeting causes stuff to happen as a direct result of the decisions made in that meeting. You, as a responsible meeting participant, are responsible for keeping track of what you need to do – and everyone in the room can prove it by summarizing their to-do list for everyone's benefit before they leave the meeting. I started realizing the importance of succinct meetings when we started doing daily stand ups at work. Typically stand-ups are timeboxed and the simple fact that you are standing instead of comfortably sitting in your char is an extra incentive to be precise and not waste any time in idle conversations, if only to get through as soon as possible. Obviously it wouldn't be reasonable for everyone to stand up during a longer meeting, but at least the speaker should. Personally, I find most meetings quite boring. I am a hardcore developer with little interest in the non technical aspects of the job and I find it quite challenging to follow and participate in meetings involving anything other than code. At a previous gig, the manager had this extremely counter productive idea that all of us should be involved in everything, and almost every week I had to sit and listen to crap I had little understanding of and absolutely no way of providing feedback for. It was a complete waste of everyone's time that soon lead to a mini riot. I know her intentions were good, but there is absolutely no reason to involve people in a meeting when they have nothing valuable to offer. At my current main gig, I'm telecommuting, and thus face some unique challenges when it comes to meetings. I can only participate via Skype, and on meetings involving more than a couple of people I find myself asking everyone (but the speaker) to shut up, almost every five minutes. Idle chatter that you may not even notice when you are in the room becomes a confusing loud buzz when you are far away and lack visual indications such as body language that help your brain focus to or completely ignore a conversation. For example, at times I find it quite hard to distinguish sarcasm, which lead to awkward moments more than once. The solution was simple enough, documentation. Having a clear agenda before the meeting, and sticking to it during, helps me concentrate on what's important and completely phase out anything that's not. A summary of to-dos (Atwood's last point) is also extremely helpful, as I can go through it at a later time and see if I've missed something important, said while the buzz was a bit louder than usual or during the few seconds that the network or Skype was acting up. You should bring up your concerns with management, or whomever is responsible for setting up the meetings at your company. ""Efficiency"" meetings can either be productive or a complete waste of time, I don't think there is a middle ground as they are inherently boring and (most) people if not engaged just give up and treat them as a break from work. When (if) that happens you have to deal with it quickly, before it gets out of hand."
251,"Burnout is not a mental dilemma. If you find a task that is engaging, interesting or relevant then you will have the mental capacity and intelligence to solve it as you have always done in the past. Burnout is not a physical dilemma. Unless your project work involves pushups you are not going to be physically burned out.  Stress may have adverse physical effects upon you though. Burnout IS an emotional dilemma! It generally comes with becoming emotionally invested in an endeavor or activity that is starting to feel fruitless and full of failure.  It is a crush on morale that wreaks havoc upon your will power to continue. The good thing is that you have intrinsically accepted the tasks and you have taken ownership of the responsibilities that were laid upon you.  It is that ownership though that has emotionally invested yourself into this project so when the project is failing you will take it hard emotionally. The true challenge is to try and turn the Rational Argument into Emotional Reasoning where you can begin to neutralize the emotional block that is hindering you.  The Rational Argument of course is: I did the best I could under the circumstances, yet forces outside of my control have caused my project to fail.  I should feel proud and learn from this. Easier said than done, and to some of us this transference of rational argument to emotional argument comes naturally.  There are a number of activities that you can perform to make this easier. Humility exercises (Eg. After a meal in a restaurant try burping as loud as you can!).  Examples like this one can help make you respond easier to embarassing situations. It also helps you willingly be okay with being judged or criticized by others. What this does is it actually helps reduce your need to feel accepted in the eyes of others.  It devalues emotional investment in favor of rational thought.  This coupled with reinforcement of the rational thought will help turn it into an accepted emotional argument. You will find that you feel good about your role and you will have increased intellectual curiosity in how things play out on a large scale, and you will have less emotional investment in the success of the project."
252,"I would include only work that was a) paid and b) in a relevant field.  I'd mention any volunteer experience or other possibly useful but not directly related experience elsewhere in an application. However, if you really feel your volunteer experience was similar enough to a real job that it should count, or your experience in a completely different job has enough in common with this one that it should be considered, I don't think it would be unacceptable to include it in the count, as long as you mentioned the specifics elsewhere in an application.  If you do that, just make sure you really do have good reasons for counting that experience, and explain them clearly - otherwise you run the risk of appearing to pad your application, and they may not consider your other claims trustworthy. As for rounding - I'd put ""0.5"" for six months, etc, if the form allows that (don't go to smaller fractions than 0.5 - I think rounding to that is reasonable enough). If the form doesn't allow it... I suppose I'd take the risk go for 1 rather than 0, since you have some experience, and then specify at the interview, along with possibly asking them to improve their form."
253,"Is it inappropriate to add a religious title on the top line of your resume?. I make my money in software development, but my real love is my ""calling"" as an ordained clergyman.  As such, my proper title is ""Reverend,"" and thus the top line of my resume is ""Rev.  Michael Hollinger."" even when I apply for software positions, I use that title, even though it is rarely relevant to the position. I want to differentiate myself from the average coder -- who, per the stereotype, is not the person you want to put in front of a customer. Additionally, there are certain types of environments that I frankly just prefer to avoid. That said, I have received unsolicited advice from people looking at my resume and online profiles.  They suggesting that I should not include my title. Indeed, one recruiter even called it offensive. Given that history, is it inappropriate to use my title in my name?"
254,"How can I boost my Key Performance Review?. I am a software developer, working on a new country, first as a contractor and now in a permanent role. My Key Performance Review (KPR) is in  1.5 months, where my contract will be extended and possibly renegotiated. What details, other than professional performance (my actual job tasks), should I take into account to make the best impression. How can I display to the directors and co-workers that I am an awesome team player?"
255,"I don't have any research, sorry. But from a ""concentrating on the job"" point of view, it seems obvious that screening out distractions would be a plus. Both visual and auditory distractions, so I think cubicles would be an improvement on an open floor plan. (Personal experience - I sat at a partially open desk facing into a room once, and ended up putting up a screen because the constant movement across my field of view distracted me too much. And having a room or at least a quiet corner of a room was definitely an improvement over constant coworker chatter.) Once you get into team productivity, the issue gets much more difficult, and depends so much on the team's style and on how often they need to communicate that I suspect general studies might not be too helpful for deciding on the best option for a specific case."
256,"I think you need to refocus on what you are trying to accomplish with a resume in the first place. A resume is a brochure with the sole purpose of selling the employer on the idea that you are worth interviewing. It is not an autobiography. That said, your question can be answered simply in terms of whether it is helping or hurting your goal of getting called for an interview. It is irrelevant whether you think it demonstrates some positive quality the employer should value. What is relevant is whether it creates a positive image in the minds of the person reading it that must make a decision about whether to pull you in for that interview. That said, I can see how it would make some HR people nervous because religion is one area that employers are prohibited from discriminating on. For the same reason that employers often prefer not to have photos attached to resumes. That is, it provides evidence that the hiring manager knew that you were a member of a protected class of candidate and if you are not hired it potentially leaves them vulnerable to hiring discrimination lawsuits. Most managers are trained not to ask about marital status, religion, age, or other things that are commonly the basis of discrimination lawsuits so it may make them uncomfortable that you have forced the information on them and exposed them to potential liability. Another concern is that hiring managers are looking not only for people that could do the job, but also a ""culture"" fit for their team. They want someone that the rest of the team will accept and work together well with. Whether it is fair or not, some managers may discriminate against you for your commitment to your religion. For example, if the a programming team is perceived as ""wild and wooly"" they might decide (illegally) that you wouldn't fit in with that group because of your piety. Whether it is fair or not, it probably has more potential to hurt your candidacy than help it. On the whole my advice would mirror that which you have already received. If it isn't relevant to the job, and you aren't positive it is a selling point, leave it off."
257,"If it's an official title (like ""Sir"" if you were a Knight, or ""Doctor"" if you had a doctorate degree, conferred upon you by another organization), I don't think it's inappropriate. Unusual, but not inappropriate. However, I don't think it helps you in the slightest in terms of getting a software job, unless your connection to the divine is going to somehow produce better code, in a way that's recognized by the larger software community. I'm not aware of any such connection, myself, for or against better code. As far as it being offensive, I don't think it's offensive at all (people should get over themselves) since you're not saying something about the company, you're saying something about yourself, so I think you're fine there. If instead you were making a direct statement about other people on your resume (for example, ""Hi, my name is Jeff, and I absolutely will not work at a place who employs people named George, or Alice."") that would be both potentially offensive and inappropriate, though strictly speaking, covered by free speech. As far as its affect on keeping you from getting offers from employers that might be offended by you being a reverend, well it does seem strange for people to care one way or the other, but I suppose it might hurt your chances in places that care about such things. That sounds like a personal choice."
258,"Does the average candidate have any recourse when they encounter an unethical recruiter?. If you've been in the white-collar job market for very long, you have likely come across recruiters who exhibit questionable ethics. The most common way I've seen this manifested is when the recruiter oversells you as a candidate, exaggerating your credentials. Then it can be extremely uncomfortable if you are asked about a particular skill that you don't have or at least not to the extent that the recruiter claimed. The worst instance I've seen is a recruiter that called my office to try and headhunt me. I was out of the office so they used the company directory to find someone else. Then they lied to that person, saying that I was moonlighting for them on a programming project, and asked if there were any other programmers they could be transferred to that could also help them with the ""project"" I was supposedly doing for them on the side. At first I had no idea what was going on, and it took a while to convince HR and my boss that I wasn't moonlighting against company policy and this was just a recruiter fishing for more programmers to entice out of the company. Ultimately, karma bit them in the butt when I was promoted to a manager position and became a potential customer for them. I told the exact story above each time their sales people called me looking to place candidates and told them I would never ever work with their company and advised fellow managers against using their firm also. Luckily I was in a situation to make them regret their unethical behavior, but I'm sure I am in the minority. Does an average job seeker have any recourse when they encounter an unethical recruiter? For example, is there a professional association for recruiters that they can be reported to? Does it do any good to contact the recruiter's company and report them directly?"
259,"One thing that could be convincing would be assembling a list of new skills you've acquired since you were hired (or since your last raise/promotion).  I should be easier for your boss to consider the possibility of a raise or promotion when it's presented as ""You started out paying $X for someone who could do A, B and C, but now you actually have someone who can do A, B, C, D and E."" A list of specific accomplishments, if they're above average compared to your coworkers, would definitely help as well. I would think of it somewhat like preparing a resume."
260,There is no standard by which that question should be answered. There is some room for interpretation by both the interviewer and interviewee. My advice is this. Be as honest as possible and don't write down anything that you wouldn't feel comfortable defending during an interview. If you are nervous about rounding it might help to put ~10 years when you really mean 9 years 11 months. Then there is no potential for them to claim you outright lied. Getting caught in a lie or a perceived lie during the recruiting process is one of the surest ways to kill your chances for getting a job. It just isn't worth risking it. Many companies do background checks for basic things like dates of employment with previous employers. It is unethical and just bad strategy to exaggerate on a resume on things that can be objectively measured and refuted.
261,"What should a freelancer do to prepare himself/herself for the transition to working as an employee?. Freelancers are used to their own schedule/deadlines/whatnot. If a freelancer has to take employment (for whatever reason), they will have to start working in the more rigid workplace. What should a freelancer do to prepare himself/herself for the transition to working as an employee?"
263,"I've never heard of recruiters going to this length, but there's always http://shame.heroku.com/ - it takes anonymously forwarded recruiter spam emails (or other undesirables), and puts them on the shame list."
265,"As a hiring manager, I have contacted a recruiter's company on two occasions to report behavior that I felt to be unethical or otherwise unacceptable.  The first case resulted in the termination of the recruiter and the second resulted in improved training and process. As a candidate, I've never had an issue working with a recruiter, however, I would contact the company if I did.  Further, I only work with firms that have a process in place for me to sign off on all submissions and all resume modifications. Recruiting firms live and die by their contracts and their contacts.  If either one of those can be impacted by the negative or inappropriate behavior of a recruiter, then you should absolutely give them a call and let them know."
266,"If you've lost contact with a person, should you stop listing them as a reference?. At a previous job I knew this person very well, she was actually my manager for over a year. Unfortunately when I left I didn't really keep in contact with her and I haven't talked to her for around eight months. I feel like she would still remember me as I was one of her star employees, but I feel awkward listing people whom I never talk too anymore. Another person was the group leader of a volunteer group with the local police department, whom I often listed as a reference whenever I've applied for security-related jobs. She knew me for three years through the program, but I've been out of the program for three more, and out of contact. Is it still acceptable to continue listing these people as references on my resume and job applications? At what point does a reference ""expire,"" if ever? Note: Verbal authorization was obtained to list these people as references previously."
267,"This is one of the most common mistakes I see job-seekers make. You should absolutely not give blind references. I've been on both sides of that call (the reference and the reference checker) and it is usually ugly and not helping the candidate one bit. You should call all your references each time you give them as a contact for a potential employer for a number of reasons: It is common courtesy not to let them get blindsided with a reference call. The obviously want to represent you well (or else why did you list them?), but unless they are prepared they may feel anxiety that they are selling you short, because they weren't prepared. When people call references they ask specific questions about job performance and even someone who loved your performance may have trouble being convincing on the details if it has been 5 years since your name crossed their mind. Also, if that reference (correctly) thinks it is rude for you to do this, it may put them in a bad mood during the reference check which may be interpreted as a knock against you. Many companies limit managers from giving very much detail on reference checks, so the people who do them become good at picking up subtle clues and reading between the lines. You don't want them picking up subtle clues from someone who is grouchy about you in general. You want to make sure the contact information is still valid. Just like your cover letter, you want to customize what your reference is going to say to the needs of the job you are seeking. At a minimum you should brief the reference in advance about what aspects of your brand you want them to emphasize. You also want to refresh their memory about all the good things you did when working for them so they have the facts at their fingertips. Just because they gave you permission to use them as a reference x years ago doesn't mean they volunteered to be your hype-man for life. It is proper etiquette to give them a chance each time to opt out of being a reference."
268,"When do I notify a potential employer of a nickname I go by?. If I have a nickname I always go by and that everyone knows me as / calls me, when do I tell this information to a potential employer? Most applications do not have a spot on them to write in a nickname or alternate name, and it would seem awkward to just randomly blurt out ""I go by..."" when you first meet them. So, when is the best time and how do I go about revealing that information? Do I tell them at my first interview, whenever they first use my name, or when they've offered me the job?"
269,"I'm going to be contrary (and potentially unpopular) here and say that you shouldn't try and work on your personal ideas on the weekend -- at least not right now. Presumably, your ideas are something in the software development realm that you would to evolve into something that can financially sustain you and your family.  By investing a significant amount of free-time into a personal software dev project, you will likely indirectly impact your performance on the software dev job for which you are currently being employed.  These impacts could be burnout, distracted focus or fatigue.  This is not necessarily fair to yourself or to your employer. So, for now, I'd recommend jotting down your ideas in an 'ideabook' with supplemental information as appropriate.  Once you get to the point that you may be ready to move on from your job, I'd revisit that 'ideabook' and see if there's anything in there you're actually willing to commit to and take a risk on.  If not, then I'd close the book and come back to it some other time. In the meantime, spend your free time playing games, reading novels, taking long walks or any other hobby that is not also your job."
270,"From what I can tell, it doesn't sound like your coworker is unmotivated or taking his work lightly, let alone that he doesn't want to meet deadlines or provide a decent product - he simply has a different idea of what that task includes than you do. ( ""My colleague just wants to make it work, but doesn't think about maintainability, documentation etc."" )  This is a conversation you should probably have with him, but I don't think it will go very well if you come off as judgemental. Just phrase it as a disagreement on the best way to accomplish the tasks, and discuss it from a practical standpoint - how to satisfy the project requirements, what's easier when the whole team works on the code, what makes it easier to find bugs, etc - rather than getting involved in questions like who is or isn't properly motivated or taking the work seriously, which will only make it more difficult to accomplish anything. Another possibility would be to take this up with management. What are their standards for maintainability, documentation, etc? If they don't have any, can you convince them to set some? Talk to the rest of the team, too. How do they feel about the quality of his work? Have any of them tried to talk to him about it already, and if so, how did it go? You'll be in a much better position when it's not just you against him, but trying to agree on some team standards."
271,"Trying to think outside the box here, because I have the same problem: Tons of ideas not enough hours in the week to see them out. Have you considered taking a ""Working vacation"" instead of trying to cram it into a weekend? Take some days off of work and commit yourself to making significant progress during those days off. The fact that you are using up your valuable vacation time might be enough to convince you to get your butt to work on those ideas."
272,"It really depends on if an opportunity presents itself.  I have a name that is commonly ""nicked"" (Jacob --> Jake).  Many interviewers will ask my if I prefer one or the other, at which point I can make my preference known.  If an opportunity such as that does not present itself, I would communicate it to HR after accepting an offer and then to my new boss on my first day (with reinforcement as I'm being introduced around if necessary.)"
274,"Many companies have a ""preferred vendor"" list. If yours does, then getting them removed from that list means that they can't ""sell"" your company candidates."
277,"10 to 14 hours is rough! If you can't get motivated to turn on a computer then don't at this point.  Stick to pen and paper.  Get your project ideas down, add any sketches or diagrams that you have in your head now and move on to the next idea. Get everything out of your head - do a full data dump. Now, motivation has to come from within so look back over your projects and see if you have anything that pulls at you, something cool, something fun, something that excites you.  When you are working that much during the week you really need something to help you unwind and relax during the weekend.  If you find you have a project that does that for you then you have a winner, if not then at least you have everything down to come back to later.  Take your time and go for a hike, go see a movie or take a nap... Or maybe even polish up your resume."
278,"Utilization opportunities for a certification. I got my certification to MCTS (Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist). I would like to pursue two goals: First, I would like to strengthen my position in my current job. Secondly, I hope, I can make the first round of applications survive better in case I have to apply externally. What should I notice for a conversation with my boss, so that my certification will be considered positive for me? In the event that at some point I need to apply external: How much weight has an MCTS in the application? Should / Do I have to tread the path to the MCPD in full? I start from the following boundary conditions: I work in the area in which the tested knowledge is applied. MCTS (70-511. NET Framwork 4, Windows Applications) At the latest in a job interview counts only real knowledge. The second part of my question refers explicitly only to the phase of the written application. Later, a small piece of paper will be meaningless if there is no substance behind it. It will only be a first proof that I, as an unknown candidate, am not a complete idiot."
280,Questions relating to receiving / earning a certificate to prove ones expertise in a specific skill or area of work
281,"Many companies like to write policies that say discussing salary/wage/benefits to be a fireable offense. The National Labor Relations Board has repeatedly held that discussing salaries, wages and benefits to be an ""organizing activity"" covered by section 7 of the NLRA and that company policies forbidding such discussions are banned because they violate section 8 of the NLRA (one example is Handicabs, Inc. v. NLRB, 95 F.3d 68 ). should I just accept that someone was a better negotiator than me signing in and not worry about it? This is typically how I accept and rationalize it. However, I'm a male, and this sort of rationalization -  that someone else is a better negotiator - can quickly land you into the mine field of gender wage disparity in the workplace. If every female earns less than every male for the same job, your company has an expensive legal problem brewing. Hiding wage information can delay such legal problems to where they become moot. Would it negatively affect the work environment? This can easily happen. I've worked at offices where one person who was a far better negotiator than the rest of us was earning almost double what the other folks who did the same job were earning. It caused a lot of grumbling and animosity because company policies didn't allow for the sort of raises that would be needed to get the lower paid folks up to what the star negotiator was making. In that case, quitting to go work elsewhere was the only way to get a raise that got me even close to what the expert negotiators were making. I've identified my poor negotiating skills to be one of the areas I need to work on."
282,"I've held Microsoft certifications for years. The only companies that seem to care about them are Microsoft Partners, and that is because the Partner program requires Partners to have a certain number of certified employees , so a ""silver"" partner requires 2 certified employees, but a ""gold"" partner will usually require 4 employees with specific certifications."
283,"Err on the side of ""overdressing."" There are more than a few companies where casual dress is not acceptable, especially in the financial industry. Scott Adams has an interesting anecdote about one interview where he dressed like a college student: When I was twenty, I was escorted out of an office building because of my choice of clothes. It happened at one of the top accounting firms in the country, and I was there for an interview during my last semester of college. I was so naïve that I didn't realize anyone would have a problem with me showing up with my long hair and casual clothes, college style. After all, it was no secret I was in college. It said so right on my resume. My interviewer sat down at the conference table, looked at me, and said, ""Apparently you don't know why you're here. Let me show you the door."" And he did. One bank I worked at would send people home who were wearing sneakers and/or jeans. I have odd shaped feet that make acquiring ""dress shoes"" a multi-week process (it is possible for me to enter a shoe store, try on every shoe in the store and find none that fit comfortably), so I had to find sneakers that were monochromatic enough to pass for dress shoes. When I do find dress shoes that fit, I now acquire enough spares to last about 20 years of normal use. In an interview, you only have a few seconds to make a first impression, and it is very hard to get over a bad beginning. My advice for reducing the risks of that part of the interview is to dress conservatively and well. One of the questions that folks interviewing IT workers is along the lines of ""can we let this person out where the customers might see them?"""
284,"How do you separate or integrate your work and home life when telecommuting?. I recently started a job where I can telecommute 1 day a week, and the hours are fairly flexible as long as you are being productive and getting your time in. I find I'm as productive if not more so at home, but on some days I'm tending to do home chores and errands more during the day and then getting the rest of the time in at night after the kids are asleep.  I wonder how sustainable that kind of work/home integration is in the long run?  I need to not only manage how effective I am at my job, but also manage that I look like I'm effective.  Is a hard separation of work and home required to do a good job AND look like you are doing a good job?"
286,"There are a few general things that might help: Get the dress code and note how people actually dress when you are there for the interview, don't forget to check footwear and make sure it isn't a causal Friday. Go shopping if you need to. Make the commute at least once during the time you will normally commute. Rush hour traffic can really change travel times, know what you are in for before your first day. Start waking up and going to sleep on schedule a few days before so your body can start to adjust. Bring headphones and music you can work to; there is probably going to be more noise than you are used to. Bring a jacket/sweater and maybe a fan if allowed, since you won't have as much control over your environment Otherwise, just be prepared to be observant and flexible as you get a feel for your workplace and how you will fit into it."
287,"Usually I just bullet point with something like: Provided technical advice and assistance to other teams and junior
developers. I prefer my resume to concentrate on the things I personally accomplished. Where you really want to stress this is in the interview. Prepare a few examples of times when you were the go-to person and helped someone out of a bad place. Usually you can find at least one question where you can bring these examples up. If nothing comes up though, when they ask you at the end why you should be hired, then bring up how much you help others and the depth of your technical knowledge. When you create your list of references include some people who will bring this up when they are called. Ask them to do so in fact. It means more to the hiring offical if someone else calls you the go-to person than if you do."
288,"When I first enterd the work world, suits were required for interviewing as they were required for daily dress. But times have changed and the workplace is much more informal. Software professionals in particular wear jeans to work every day at most workplaces. I don't even own a suit anymore. For an interview, you are trying to make a good impression. Ask the person who sets up the interview what the company dress standard is if you feel unsure of what to wear. Then dress one notch above that. So if they all come to work in jeans, wear slacks and a nice shirt if you are male and a dress pants or a skirt with a nice top if you are a woman. Women have some special issues associated with interviewing. This is not the place to wear very short miniskirts or any attire that shows your bra straps or cleavage or belly button. Keep sexy for outside the office. Do not wear killer high heels. You want to be taken seriously as a professional not as a potential date. Whatever you wear, make it neat and tidy and clean. No matter how informal the office is, leave off the t-shirts with the funny sayings or the obnoxious or political messages. Even if you choose to come in jeans, wear a nice shirt."
289,"""Is a hard separation of work and home required to do a good job?"" -- No, in my experience. I've always played very loosely with schedules, worked from home on weekends and done short weekdays to compensate etc, and I think, if anything, I'm more productive on average, because I end up doing the work when I'm in a productive mood. (Sometimes I just have a great solution to some problem at midnight on a Saturday, and spend the next two hours coding in bed... That said, I don't have children, so my schedule is a lot more flexible in general. I do get plenty of free time, just not necessarily in the standard time slots.) ""Is a hard separation of work and home required to look like you are doing a good job?"" -- This is a difficult question, and depends a lot on the type of work you do and on the culture at your workplace.  However, I'm not sure how it applies to your case - either way, you're telecommuting on Friday, so your coworkers/supervisor can't see whether you're doing your work in one block or mixing it up with chores and making it up in the evening. So who exactly is it that needs to think you look like you're doing a good job?"
290,"I have more years of work experience than my boss has been alive. But he is one of the best bosses I've ever worked for. First, he has made it clear he values my experience and he asks for my input into a variety of technical issues. But it is also clear that while he listens to what I have to say, he is the final arbiter of what we will do. Second, he rewards good work and lets people know when they need to improve - his subordinates are never kept guessing as to how he feels about their work. He is fair. Nobody is perfect and he will need to discuss issues with any one of us. He discusses issues in private and gives out praise in public. Issues when they are brought up are never personal attacks or blame sessions. The discussions are more along the lines of this is what went wrong and what can we do to prevent it from happening again. He seeks input and more importantly, he makes sure to take that input to higher levels and makes sure we get the credit for our suggestions if higher management buys off on them. He pushes for promotions and pay raises for his people. We have an awards program and he takes the time to make sure at least one of his employess is nominated each time the awards cycle comes around. He makes it easy to tell him you need emergency leave and to make sure your work is covered. It is easy to accept someone with less experience as your boss when he treats you and all his other subordinates well. Now it's trickier if the person wanted that promotion himself. It's best to sit down and talk about the situation openly. Tell him how much you value his experience; tell him that you want to make sure the next promotion has his name on it. If you know why he was passed over (sometimes it's obvious to everyone except the person passed over), then discuss that too. Let him know what he needs to do to improve his chances of being selected. Likely he is not as politically savvy as he should be, help him to see what actions he needs to take to get credit for his work and if you promise to help promote his cause to management, make sure he hears you giving him credit for his good work. One compliment to a higher boss that he hears will do a lot ot relieve any anxiousness about you. That said, you are the boss now and he has to respect that too whether he is happy about your promotion or not. So don't let him get away with behaving badly. The sooner you confront behavior like trying to override what you are saying in public, the sooner it will get fixed. If you don't confront early, it may very well escalate until you have an actual performance issue to deal with officially.  If he thinks he call bully you, he will. Tell him privately that you don't want him to interrupt you when you are talking to others. Tell him you will ask for his input when training others or presenting things to management and make sure he gets the credit."
291,"The most important rule: the freelancer should acknowledge that he is on the other side of the rules now. He is going to make some things he doesn't like, he is going to attend some meetings he will find to be very boring. Then there are lots of advantages and disadvantages for the transition that he will discover later."
293,"What is the best way to keep up productivity in crisis situations?. In the situation of crisis, as a manager or senior manager level person, but not the top management folk, managing people and indirectly the project becomes difficult. By crisis I mean when the company has a major revenue losses, existence in the market becomes much more difficult than what normally otherwise seen by people -may be close to shutdown or takeover! In situations like this, there are many parts of the problem including lack of motivation, people tending to be less efficient and lack focus in the time of anxiety. Most people are looking out for the alternative jobs, even newly joined folks who otherwise had a lot of enthusiasm lack the understanding of how to place. Overall, the place becomes a mess, and it's difficult for projects to succeed. However, it is the most crucial time where success and winning is exactly what you want. How exactly, do you handle situations like this? I am assuming that while management might do its own effort, it may not always be very effective. My specific question is: How to maintain the productivity and focus of a workforce in the middle of all the distractions? Any practical tips or principles would help."
295,"Am I required/expected to notify current boss that I'm looking for a new job?. When I changed jobs last year, my previous boss was very insulted that I didn't tell him I was looking for a job and didn't ask him for a reference letter.  (I did give him a month's notice when leaving.) Is it usual or expected to notify your current workplace that you're considering leaving, and to ask your current employer to act as a reference? If so, in what circumstances would it be acceptable not to do so?  If it's not generally expected, are there any cases where it would be?"
296,"How do you balance long term and short terms goals?. We are a product company, where some amount of work goes on on the research front. On the other hand - product is deployed at various client places. And of course new classes of clients are continuously sought after. However, the core team is essentially same. When a new problem or client comes up everyone has to drop all their futuristic ideas and go back to war level regime. Again, back to work. This remains on and off. And there is not much possibility to keep separate teams, because inherent (algorithmic) work really requires core expertise to solve issues. What are some of the best mechanisms or techniques that allows you to keep up the rythm? What help i can take from system and processes or from the management to help situation better?"
298,"What to do when recruiters don't count freelancing work as experience. There was a period when I was an individual freelancer, without having formed a proprietorship or something and without having official certificates of experience. Though I made it, after sometime I dropped freelancing and returned to a regular job. Generally, during interviews people praise the fact that you are self driven, as you have been freelancing. However, when HR folks calculates pay packages, I think they use it as an excuse and define my freelancing period as years without relevant experience. So, it looks like it's as big a disadvantage as not having a job during that period. What is expected as career experience from freelancing years? How do you appropriately present that experience to potential recruiters? EDIT Just as suggested by people, there has been a good tech project i had done which was also listed in resume. I had international publications out of that work as well. And i was critically evaluated on that very project because that was most relevant work they had got unlike any other candidate. I think my direct bosses did understand the value of my work and depended on me critically; but HR only used this as an excuse."
299,"I suspect that this will probably be one that will vary a bit from country to country. I can only speak from my experiences in Ireland: No, you are under no obligation to tell your current employer that you're looking for a new job Yes, it would be typical to ask your current employer for a reference (though typically only once you've resigned) Exceptions to the first rule might include situations where you're a one-person team and you don't want to leave your current employer in the lurch. However, these truly are exceptions, and not the rule. In general, giving your employer an opportunity to replace you is what a notice period is for."
300,"First off:  Loyalty is not depth. Good depth in a single problem of courses requires that you stick to one place and be loyal. But great number of times people do same repetitive work without learning anything new or enhancing new skills. Such things is NOT really better depth. Many a times, I do find candidates who have been around for more than 5 or 7 years. This is indeed great. But then you look at the depth of his/her work. Has the person continued more projects, higher up in the responsibilities or has been stuck without any significant growth? Or has she/he been only stuck at a position. On the other hand there are candidate has been almost always changing the job, say every 6 months or 1 year; If people jump too often it is a sign that they don't stick to some or most problems too long and or  have severe problems with aligning the work place culture and hence cann't stick around. Such people might run away in the middle of the project keeping jeopardy. People who have left critical assignments just because of more money or bad days of company, it is a sign that you cann't quite trust that person to fight in a critical project. Of course, of many changes, you might have took up one or two odd positions where you might find yourself misfit - but that's not that bad. So - a right measure to judge whether jump that people took should be reasonable. 
In one of the books by Jack-Welch - Winning , he writes: ..why the candidate left his previous job, and the one before that.""
  This ""tells you more about them than almost any other piece of data.""
  (p. 96 - Winning) The essential answer he gives is that when people change because of desire the learn more and do more exciting challenging stuff - it is the right candidate. If the candidate has continued growth and a long tenures (fewer jumps) it is really ideal hire. But all else depend on his individual performance on certain projects. If the person has at least one or two great projects, it is a reason to believe that he will be willing to at least attack the work and finish things and will fight for challenging problems."
301,"What is the best method for communication for sites in multiple continents?. I have a project where the team members that I have to deal with are located in different continents than I am. This brings in issues such as time-zone differences, cultural sensitivities, and language issues. Other than email, what communication media would be suitable for delivering information such as status reports and weekly meetings?"
302,"I don't think that there is a single ""best"" solution to this. What works for one team might not work for yours. Video conferencing is a big plus. It really does help team-building if you can see the other members of the team. You don't have to do this everyday, but having a team video call as one of your weekly meetings at least once a month will help. Having a group telephone call as your weekly meeting is probably a must. I'm currently working on a project where our partner team is in the US. Our weekly meeting happens in the afternoon UK time and first thing in the morning US time. You need to find a time that's mutually convenient - or at least not too inconvenient for all participants. With regard to language - pick one that everyone knows and use that. It may even turn out not to be the first language of anyone in the meeting. I was at an international meeting once where the official language was English, but a Spaniard and a German conducted a side discussion in French because that was the language they could understand each other best in. As for cultural sensitivities - education is necessary as is environment where everyone knows is OK both to raise an issue and (as long as it's not malicious) make mistakes without fear of too much backlash. If someone says something out of turn, say so straight away and move on. If you encourage team members to talk on Skype (or other instant messaging system) outside the meetings then people will get to know each other and this should become less of a problem."
303,"It is not expected that you inform your boss that you are looking for a new job, and it's certainly not required. Look at it the other way: Would your employer give you more than the minimum legal notice if they were thinking of firing you or making you redundant? The answer to that is probably ""no"". The notice period in your contract is there to notify your employer of your intentions to leave. In some countries/industries you get escorted from the premises as soon as you hand in your notice - for all sorts of reasons. These same reasons would apply when you reveal your intentions to move and if the move didn't happen then you'd be in an infinitely worse position than you were before. In respect of a reference - in the UK all that a previous employer has to give is confirmation of the dates you worked there. So there should be no issue of not asking for a reference."
304,"Out there in India, most important clients sit on the other side of the earth - namely US. So this is extreme example of Cross continent, worse timezone differences, critical project communication reporting and relationship management. Here are a few things most IT companies here in India follows. There is at least 1 guy from India office tend to shift and be available to the other side - so he/she practically work on other side timezone. All primary communications are handled by this single point of entry so as to avoid any wrong requirements or misunderstandings. It becomes critical that all communication is logged and properly routed through all concerned. As regards to the language and cultural issue, if the project cost permits, they deploy one person or small team on-site. They are responsible for this core work and get true understanding and troubleshooting issues such that team at off-shore is driven in the right direction. Face-to-face or verbal (phone/ messengers) but still provide most valuable channels, yet, the primary coordinating people would tend to note down their conclusions/understanding and document it through emails. There is no better replacement for formal communication than emails. And it is always essential. Usually, timing of the other shore becomes chunk deadlines. Every morning - the US clients expect something ready to test/use. And by end of the day they communicate the issues or work for tomorrow. The more rythm and discipline you have in tracking of project and communication - the better it gets."
305,"In a poor economy it would be inadvisable to quit a job before you have a new one. In a US state where you work ""at will"" they can fire you for almost any reason. You take the risk that they will let you go the moment you tell them you are looking. This doesn't happen very often, but what does happen is that they can start to think of you as being disloyal or only going to be around for a short period of time. They won't send you to training, or add you to the new project. Telling them you are looking does mean that in some cases they will offer you a raise, a promotion, or a transfer. Some times that is just a delaying tactic, and then they still view you as disloyal. In the end you may delay your departure for a while but ultimately you end up leaving. You have no requirement in the United States to tell them, and little practical reason to do so. Most companies you interview with will avoid getting a reference from your current company, especially if you let them know your current boss is unaware you are looking."
306,"What should be the best criteria for deciding of lay-offs?. Even in good times lay offs of people can happen for extreme poor performance or disciplinary issues. However, Lay offs in the time of recession is quite another things. Usually several departments gets notice to identify people they MUST reduce and find alternative team size planning. What are the criteria and evaluation procedures should be to judge how many people should be in lay off and who should be targeted? How can you ensure that decisions of such layoffs are never emotionally driven?"
307,"You have a couple of opportunities. Some put their nickname on their resume, others (Michael to Mike) mention it in the interview. You can also  wait until you put together their email signature. The confusing ones are those that can make it hard to find the employee in the email system. You may want to let your company know before IT has a chance to set up the email system."
308,"Should I include information about my reputation on professionally-relevant Stack Exchange (or other Q&A) sites on my resume?. Should I include any information about Stack Exchange, or more generally, any Q&A, sites that I am an active contributor to on my resume? If so, how prominent should this information be and at what level of detail should I include? I am particularly concerned about striking the correct balance between giving this point appropriate prominence, without appearing to give it higher priority than more important points, such as previous experience."
309,"As a candidate, there is not much that you can do other than apologise for the behaviour of the recruiter. As you suggest, what goes around, comes around . The more stupid tricks recruiters pull, the less likely they are to be trusted and the less likely they are to get business in the future. Anyone who finds themselves in this situation should find that people will be generally understanding if it is explained that there appears to have been some misunderstanding. If you identify that a recruiter has over-sold you, then you just have to explain, apologise for their behaviour and possibly cut the interview short to avoid wasting any more of anyone's time. As a hiring manager, avoid these recruiters like the plague. They are wasting your time and the time of potential candidates. As Tangurena suggests, a company wide black-list is too good for them. Whatever your position in this situation, if you really feel strongly about a recruiter, make sure that the recruitment firm knows about the behaviour of it's employees, as Jacob G recommends."
310,"This is simply a matter of professionalism. If your nick-name is acceptable within the culture of the company, there should be no reason not to introduce yourself with that moniker during the interview. If however your nick-name is more personal than a contraction or common substitution (Dave for David, Bob for Robert) then you might want to wait until you have the job before going around and telling people to call you something else. Essentially, at an interview, I would expect to call someone by the name the provided on their CV (resume), but I would be happy to accept that people may prefer to use a different name for official correspondence or a contract than in personal interactions."
311,"Far more important than trying to motivate people is help them by removing the barriers to them motivating themselves . The reason for this is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation . From the Wikipedia page: Intrinsic motivation refers to motivation that is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on any external pressure. Extrinsic motivation comes from outside of the individual. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards like money and grades, coercion and threat of punishment. Competition is in general extrinsic because it encourages the performer to win and beat others, not to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A crowd cheering on the individual and trophies are also extrinsic incentives. According to research, intrinsic motivators are much more powerful than extrinsic motivators: At lower levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs , such as physiological needs, money is a motivator, however it tends to have a motivating effect on staff that lasts only for a short period (in accordance with Herzberg's two-factor model of motivation). At higher levels of the hierarchy, praise, respect, recognition, empowerment and a sense of belonging are far more powerful motivators than money Now while there is little evidence of Maslow's hierarchy itself, it is a useful hook when describing intrinsic verses extinsic motivators. The surprising thing that comes out of the research though, is that providing extrinsic motivators can actually reduce or remove the intrinsic motivators: Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to overjustification and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation. In one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition and to children who received no extrinsic reward. 1 Undermining Children’s Intrinsic Interest with Extrinsic Reward; A Test of ‘Overjustification’ Hypothesis , Lepper, Greene & Nisbett. Thus, in general it is far more effective to remove barriers intrinsic motivation than it is to try an increase extrinsic motivators. This was the essence of many elements of both DeMarco & Lister 's Peopleware and Fred Brooks ' The Mythical Man-Month . These should be considered essential reading for any manager of software engineers, but could also help managers of other knowledge workers. For more information, I would highly recommend this animation of one of Daniel Pink 's talks on his book "" Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us "".*"
312,"Unless you know that the employer is active on StackOverflow or another StackExchange site, I would avoid making your reputation and activity very explicit. You might list that you're active on StackExchange in an ""Interests"" section. If the employer is aware of the site and values it, they'll look you up or ask for your username. I would say that a more appropriate place to mention your profile is an online medium like LinkedIn. Having a link there doesn't seem out of place and adds to your overall online appearance. And as ChrisF mentioned on Programmers , make sure that if you do include your profile in any way that your profile represents you well. You should view your profile in this case as an extension of your résumé, so make it look just as professional."
313,"With regards to a discussion with your boss, one would hope that if you work in the domain in which the knowledge tested for the certification is applied, your boss would immediately say ""You got your MCTS? That's great!"" and open the door for you to point out any specific aspects of the tested knowledge that you'd like to start putting into practice, or that you'd like to focus more on.  If you are working in the same domain and your boss says ""The MCTS? What's that?"" then your job in expressing the benefit to the company will be more difficult but just have a meeting with him or her to give an overview of the knowledge you gained and then (still) how you would like to start putting that into practice. About how a certification looks on a job application, it depends on where you're looking to apply -- see @Tangurena's answer.  For companies for whom certifications matter (as an HR filter or otherwise), any certification will help, but the further along you are, the better you'll look at screening time.  However, note that there are plenty of companies for whom certification does not matter, and you will invariably interview with people who find pure disdain for certifications. In both cases, if you know why you've gone through the learning processes and achieved certifications, and can speak to the benefits that they add to you as an employee, you will put yourself in a better position than if your answer is ""I got this certification because everyone said to."""
314,"As one other comment suggested, you have to explore the possibility that something other than salary and location is hurting your ability to find good talent. I live and work as a software developer in the greater Pittsburgh area and Allegheny Valley (roughly 2 million people).  Like many other smallish urban areas there are the handful of large employers but there are also a good deal of technology startups and CMU initiatives.  Beyond this however the pool of software developers is small per capita compared to other areas.  There are rarely more than 2 degrees of separation between any two developers, as many of us know and have work with each other or at least in the same company, or we met each other at various local tech council meetings and conferences. The developers in a small urban area talk. We generally give each other heads up about the companies that are awesome, the up and coming, the grueling sweatshops, and the chronically understaffed/overcommitted/employee-abusers. I worked for a few such, lets say, ""negatively viewed"" companies and found that it actually hurt my career.  I like my job with my current boss, but he told me that he almost threw my resume away when he saw that I worked for _____ for 4 years, with the reasoning that anybody who stays there longer than 2 is probably not smart enough to know to escape. If your company has a negative reputation amongst the developer pool for whatever reason then this may be why you are experiencing trouble finding good candidates even willing to interview with you. One way I have seen such companies handle this is to sponsor H1B visas to help fill the gap.  The talent for the most part can be comparable if you are careful.  I have seen this system be abused though as a means to either grossly underpay for talent or a more insidious strategy of basically putting these H1B workers in an extremely tough or demanding situation and holding them hostage by not giving up their sponsorship or delaying and inhibiting any attempt to escape to a new job."
315,"Layoffs are nothing more than a shortened period of the status quo. The top performers should be promoted, and those contributing the least value should be sacked. When we were reorganizing, I remember the leader of our organization said it best: ""Yes, we are reorganizing. I suspect the people that fear it most are the ones that have the least to worry about. If you are engaged in the company, productive in your work, and genuinely care about your team, you are probably already doing the things you need to be doing. if this doesn't apply to you, I have to ask you two questions: are you applying yourself? And if not, why did you bother applying here at all?"" In other words, be the best worker you can be. In the long run, it's the only strategy that'll work. If you are making the cuts, the same advice should apply. Keep your best talent, regardless of function, and use the opportunity to simply accelerate the departure of your underperforming colleagues. Typically, in a layoff situation, you have eliminate a certain number or percentage of positions. Remove the psiitons, then fill those positions with your best talent. For everybody else in this game of musical chairs, when the music stops, the people without a seat need to go home. If your whole function is made redundant, top performers usually have connections in other departments, or if nothing else, in similar functions at other workplaces. If nothing else, you will have the satisfaction of knowing you did all you could."
316,"How to handle a superior who is an 'information sink'. How do you handle a situation where you have provided useful information/ideas to your immediate boss, because you know/feel that information would be of interest to their boss, and you come to learn that it has just disappeared into a black hole?"
317,"It depends (as the Q&A on Programmers.SE points out), but putting a notice in an ""Interests"" section cannot hurt, as root45 mentions . I just want to add the fact that some professions consider time spent on StackExchange sites as ""service to the profession"" -- in particular , the Project Management Institute (PMI) allows claiming of PDUs (professional development units) for time spent asking and answering questions at Project Management.SE . I don't know if ""impress"" is the right term to use, but when I evaluate resumes and I see that potential employees are participating in informal and volunteer communities of knowledge, and gaining reputation in those communities, I consider it a bonus.  I think StackExchange itself assessed market value (and usefulness) by constructing Careers 2.0 the way that they did."
318,"Definitely Yes! And further, let that objective really be an objective . In our hiring process, usually I go through lots of resumes and as a recruiter I am pained that people don't quite write a clear-cut objective and keep me guessing till the interview. What types of objectives make sense? It should clearly define what type of role, company and job profile you are looking for - some examples - Looking for project manager position - in XYZ industry I have done programming and design for four years - now looking to become a tech lead I have been in sales in industry for XYZ - now looking for outside of that industry I have been in research area for 10 years, - now looking for higher management position I worked as a product manager - now I want to move in business development strategy ... and so on. Good objective statements should be very clear and rather simple. They should sound very obvious and it should make sense! If you happen to find more than five adjectives you are telling nothing. The essential idea is that if you are very clear of what you want (and don't want) to do - it helps recruiter identify whether you are the one or not - and if not, it will save everyone's time including yours. This means you might NOT receive some calls - but that would be worth it. My blog post: How (not) to write resumes ."
319,"This all very much depends on what the culture is like at your organization.  If you have the more informal work culture where it is acceptable for you to step into the office of your bosses boss and just talk about what is on your mind then this is what I would suggest. If you have a more rigid command structure or if your bosses boss is not easily approachable however this behavior may not be acceptable or viewed as subverting your bosses authority. Either way you are telling your immediate boss what you feel is important information and you assume that this information didn't flow up the command chain.  When the two of them have status meetings together you have no way of knowing exactly what they are talking about.  The possibility exists that this information was shared. If the information was shared it might have been noted and accounted for future plans. It might have been ignored and deemed irrelevant by your bosses boss based on information that you and/or your immediate boss is not privy to. Your immediate boss may not have shared it because he/she deemed it irrelevant based on information that you may not privy to. The bottom line is that you should start with a conversation, one with your immediate boss and let him/her know your concerns. Do not be accusatory , simply inquisitive.  Avoid confrontational words like You do/don't or Your and instead use informative words like I feel or My perspective ."
320,"How to capture and manage the minutes of meeting for the team?. Usually in many meetings some designated person note down various points/minutes and send that note as an email to all participants. However, overtime i find that emails become too much of a pile of information. It becomes difficult to track the meetings and specially followup the meetings on the same subject. What are some best tools and practices for collecting and managing minutes of meeting? How do you organize it and make it accessible to the team (and yourself) for future reference?"
321,"Much here is described a bit vague, so I do not know if my ideas fit your situation. Do you have a regular meeting (in private)? Ask him why he did not pass the information. Maybe he has a plausible rationale for its filtering. Have you a canteen? Few details could be discussed at the table when ""accidentally"" sits next to the next boss. Do you fear a disaster in a particular project? Distribute the information in writing, for example e-mail. No one can accuse unto thee later, you said nothing. (But in that case, you lost anyway) Perhaps you could you be more specific on your situation."
322,"In situations like the one you described transparency is very important. Your employees must know what is happening before they begin to create false scenarios. If they create false scenarios they will freak out and leave eventually creating a hard-to-fill gap. So be fair, don't lie, be transparent. Ensure you are telling them the bad parts and the good parts. Good employees will understand the situation and will stick with you if they trust you."
325,"I think the solution here is knowing when and how to say No to clients. You must have a long term vision for the product and adapt client needs to that vision. Every client need must be somehow converted to a compatible product change. Radical client-specific changes will break your product. So there is no 100% percent working solution. It's just you need to grow your skill to adapt your product in order to fulfill the long-term goals, while keeping the customers happy by working on short term goals."
326,"If you have high turnover and overall poor morale, then you need to coordinate with the leaders both above you and below you and consider overhauling something in your process, because whatever it is you're currently doing is pretty obviously not working. Unfortunately, your question is somewhat vague, so I can't give you better information on what exactly needs changed. It might be worth bringing in a consultant to help you identify specific things that need fixed, so here's some general stuff. In short, if you're in crisis mode something went wrong . If you're constantly in crisis mode something is wrong with your system and needs changed yesterday. In general, it sounds as if your projects routinely go beyond the scheduled time (or threaten to do so, and require overtime to keep it on track). This is evidence of failures in project management. Either the project manager genuinely doesn't know what the team is capable of producing in a given amount of time (ie - they think the team can complete a task in 2 days, when in reality, it takes a week), or they try to promise things faster, thinking the team will just work over to get it done. Either way, it spells disaster for the project, and burnout for the team. Meet with the leaders below you (not just managers, but non-management employees that show leadership tendencies and have been working harder to help keep the project organized and on track) and find out how they feel. Very often, there is a disconnect between management and workers in situations like this. Management often thinks that something is wrong with the employees when something doesn't go right, while the employees find themselves under impossible deadlines and their jobs on the line for decisions made by higher-ups. Make the necessary changes to your fundamental way of doing things to prevent the crisis situations to begin with. Some things to find the answers to (this is by no means all-inclusive): How are schedules determined? Are they based in reality? Does the project manager consider (or know) the capabilities of the team? Or are they based on what the project manager thinks the tasks should take, or (even worse) what the client thinks the tasks should take? Is the project manager using scoping techniques to determine timelines and time slack? Are members of the build team involved? The people that are actually building your products will know the best what timelines are realistic. Including a lead or senior member will help make sure that your project manager isn't overpromising. Does the schedule reflect reality? Is meeting time included in the schedule? A team may be able to finish a project in 8 hours if that's all they're working on, but if you're holding them up for 2 hours in a meeting, it's going to put them behind if that's not accounted for in the schedule. Additionally, some industries are prone to scope creep , which can turn a good project sour in a hurry. Make sure you're accounting for it by updating the schedule accordingly and enforcing the scope creep clause in your contract with your client (you do have one, right?). Is the project methodology you're using actually working for your projects? If you're a software company, using the Waterfall Method to develop, and your clients are notorious for wanting new features three quarters of the way through the project, then the Waterfall Method is not for you. Learn about and switch to an agile method to better adapt to your clients' and company's needs. Do you have reviews after project completion? I'm not just talking about reviews of the build team, but reviews of everything. Interview both employees and managers, and get their opinions on what went wrong and what went right. What worked? What utterly failed? What didn't fail, but could be better? Do you have a method of tracking and prioritizing tasks? If everything is of highest priority, then nothing has priority. You should have a system in place that communicates what needs to be done, the priority that each item has, what depends on that task (and what tasks that one depends on), and when the task is due. Second - and this may seem counterintuitive - invest in your employees . They are the lifeblood of your company, without them, your company will fall , treat them accordingly. Instead of laying people off, hire more. This will improve overall morale because one, you're not putting people on the chopping block (which by default lowers morale, as their job security is called into question), and two, you're giving the project the needed man-hours without requiring large amounts of overtime from everyone, preventing burnout. At the end of these projects under the ""old way of doing things,"" reward your employees with mandatory paid time off (ie - make them take a vacation so they can recharge). If you find that there are genuine issues with how the employees work (keep in mind that knowledge workers often work best with short breaks every hour or so; so make sure you're not mistaking the usual productivity cycles with real issues), get them training on time management. Cater their lunches, even if it's just a couple of times a week. This gives them one less thing to worry about, and shows that you care about them, boosting morale. If applicable, create a new company culture that allows for employees to pursue their own (work-related) interests. This allows employees to work on a different type of project than what they typically work on, boosting morale and helping stave off burnout. Yes, these things will cost money, but you're losing far more money on turnover costs and failed projects. Additionally, these things have long-term ROI, because by investing in your employees, they will become more productive as they start to relax and actually find some enjoyment in their work."
327,"As a student, I was extremely hesitant to ever put my GPA on my resume, even though my cumulative overall GPA was always above a 3.0 and my field-of-study GPA was typically a couple of tenths of a point higher than that. However, if you don't have a work history in your field of study, you might not have anything else that makes you stand out from other peers, especially when everyone has the same summer jobs and the same class projects on their resume. Once you start having work experience or personal projects that are relevant, there's little need to include it on your resume anymore. These experiences will be what sets you apart from other people applying for the same jobs. I'm not sure exactly how much relevant experience qualified as enough to remove your GPA - that sounds like a personal decision. However, you said that you have 5-6 years of experience, and I think it's safe to say that's enough."
328,A recording of the meeting using tools like Camtasia and a simple log/to-do list should be enough. Keep meetings as simple and short as possible.
329,"First and foremost, make sure that they understand that your freelancing was for real, professional projects. A lot of people (particularly large companies) think that ""freelancing"" is just a fancy way of saying that you built your mom's sister's dog's vanity page and got paid $10 to do it. Explain the work you've done building your business relationships. Even if you weren't registered as a corporation, you were still in business. People hired you to perform a service, you (should have) filed tax paperwork accordingly, you played manager, project manager, employee, accountant, and more, and so on. Make sure that is clear from the very beginning. Once you get to the point of negotiating salary, the company has decided that they want you. Therefore, you have more leverage for negotiation than in the interview process. Explain to them that your freelancing experience is still professional experience (and may even be no different than what the company does) and that you feel you should be compensated accordingly. Oftentimes, the company will be willing to work with you, but of course, be prepared to walk away from it if you think you're being undercompensated. However do keep in mind that you might not get paid the same rate as an employee as you would a freelancer. I can't speak for other countries, but in the United States, freelancers can typically charge 2 to 3 times what their ""traditional"" counterparts get paid, because freelancers have to take care of their own benefits (health insurance, 401k, time off, etc) and the ""employer"" half of income taxes. So make sure you take your benefits into account when considering a compensation package."
330,"Should a negative online presence be weighed when considering potential employees?. Accounts on Stack Overflow, github, what have you will contribute positively to your online presence and may give you an edge over other candidates with equal experience that don't have them. However, should a negative online presence have the opposite impact? Examples of a negative online presence being, say, a public social networking account where you profanely deride your past workplace/boss, or somewhat scandalous information that could frankly be used to blackmail you, found within 30 seconds of googling the email address you use in your resume. (Of course, I think there's a very big distinction between information that's public, and the ridiculously invasive practice of requesting social network credentials during interviews that's currently causing such a stir.)"
331,"Generally managers are given a target number of how much they need to reduce the budget ina layoff or told which departments need to go entirely (suppose you are closing one whole line of business, the easiest way to do the layoff is to let all of those people go).  Depending on the the country or the organization, you may have specific rules/laws about the order that people can be chosen for a layoff. While it is true that it is prefered to keep the strongest performers when you can, layoffs are often about reducing functions. So it doesn't matter if your top performers are in the department you are told to eliminate entirely particularly if it is a specialist position and they cannot qualify for the jobs that are staying. Further, the lower level managers are generally not consulted in a layoff )as they may be people inthe pool to be laid off) and they are the people who know the actual performance best. So if you as a lower level manager want to help your people be the ones who stay in a layoff, make sure they have the best performance evaluations the oprganzation will let you give them. Make sure to nominate your people for awards. Make sure to let senior mangers hear their names in a positive way. Don't try to base your decsion on personal factors like who you perceive will be most hurt by the layoff. Everyone laid off will be harmed and you do not know all the factors in thier financial lives to know who will be most harmed. So don't lay off the single people because the ones with kids need the money more (Hey I have to eat too and I may have children and I don't have the luxury of a second income already coming in), don't layoff the women because they all have men to provide for them (we don't), etc. Do try to identify who might have critical knowledge about the work that will be remaining and try to make a case to keep those people. We had a layoff one time where all the choices were made by HR and Finance (who work in a spearate state and thus did not personally know anything about the people except what was inthier official record) and they appeared to chose basedon a combination of performance eveluation or salary with no reagrd to how that woudl affect ongoing projects. We lost several key people on a multi-million dollar project. It caused delays and cost overruns."
332,My company uses Microsoft OneNote . It does a decent job and is easy to collaborate with so you can have people confirm what they said and correct the notes as needed after the meeting.
334,"Maybe these  two items may help you: you're a fast learner, willing to investigate more that the day to day issues (ie learning a new language); you are going to participate in/organize developer-focused meetings in order to find new ways to do your job; Then ensure you will keep these promises :)"
335,"It isn't customary and shouldn't be expected to tell your employer that you are looking for a new job before you have one lined up. It is probably a bad idea because it can taint your image as someone who won't be around long if you don't find another opportunity and decide to stay. That said, I can see why your boss might feel that way. As a manager it is frustrating to lose an employee who never communicated any complaints and just leaves without giving you a chance to remedy the situation. You have to really trust your supervisor to tell them you are considering other opportunities before you have one in the bag. It sounds like you boss is a little disappointed that you didn't have that level of trust with them. However, it is somewhat of a catch-22. If you had that level of trust, you probably would be less likely to be looking for another job in the first place."
336,Lay offs are a business decision.  The best choice is to lay off those people whose loss will have the least impact on the bottom line.  Any other decision is poor business and short changes those employees left trying to keep the business going forward.
337,"As a candidate, i would always keep GradePoint/UniversityScore in the resume. You never know what is in the mind of recruiter. I don't quite rule out the possibility that some recruiters will find it important. However, as a recruiter, i personally don't care much. There are times when people don't quite shine in university system but do exceptionally well in the practical outlook of the problems in real world. So in general, grade point becomes least criteria and work experience matters much. However, when you are a fresher, probably there is no other measure (job experience) is available. So grade point does become the primary (if not ultimate) criteria. So it is most important."
338,"First of all know the law in your jurisdiction. Make sure you are not being discriminatory, that can lead to a law suit. Understand why the layoffs are being made. Did you just lose a contract? Are you dropping a product line? Are you closing a store? Or are sales / profits down? Can you absorb some of the people into other functions/ locations? Some organizations can reduce the number of people losing their job by freezing hiring throughout the company, and asking for current employees to transfer. Have you set up a way for other managers to reach out to your employees to fill their needs? Once you have exhausted all the other options you then have to see who is left in the functions/ areas that have to be cut. If they don't have some skill that you will need in the vary near future you will have to let them go. Let employees in danger of being laid off know as early as possible so they can look inside and outside of the company. The worst situation is when you have to let people go from areas that are to survive the reorganization, but other more valuable people in areas to be cut need to be saved. The best approach is to do the cuts in two stages. First merge the two organizations, then a few months later cut the excess positions. The merger puts people on alert. Some will move on their own, thus reducing the number of hard choices. It also lets you do more direct comparisons of individuals."
339,"Always make your important information exchanges over email.  This provides a document you and those involved with the issue something to refer to and makes sure that there is no black hole.  If the exchange happens in person I send a confirmation email summarizing the important  details of what was discussed. I CC all people directly involved/impacted unless there is a specific reason not to.  My intent is never to break the chain of command but to ensure that the information gets disseminated properly with out requiring my manager to do additional work. Any time the matter is sensitive, and is not proper to share on my own, I will include an action item in the email to let me know how to go forward, asking if who I should share the information with, and/or request confirmation that this is how they understand it, as the best fits the scenario.  If nothing is returned I will followup, sometimes including my plans(that generally include relevant dissemination) to go forward unless I hear otherwise.  The goal is not to cut out your direct supervisor but to help the business in the best way possible."
340,"Even when dealing with publicly available information...here be dragons. First and foremost, can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the online presence is actually the person in question? Between people that look similar and/or share names, and some simply downright nasty trolls, it's possible that the person that posted such things is not the same person that is applying for a given position. Make sure you're making the right connection. That said, it in part depends on what actually constitutes a ""negative online presence."" Defaming a current or past employer is one thing, and pretty obviously should be considered. As Chad said, such behavior can be a cancer in the workplace, poisoning the whole group. Getting drunk with friends is a different matter (so long as it is legal and doesn't interfere with work), and in my opinion, it's ludicrous to think that just because you can't see evidence of it, that no one else in the company does the same thing once in a while. Additionally, make sure that you're not attributing behavior of your prospective employee's friend/family/acquaintances to your employee. It's easy to say ""well, if my other employees do it, they're smart enough to not plaster it all over the Internet,"" but what if your prospective employee didn't put up those pictures (because they, too, are ""smart enough to not plaster it all over the Internet"")? What if someone else at the party took and posted the pictures, and someone else tagged the employee? The employee didn't post those pictures, and they have no control over the person who did. Should the employee be faulted for someone else's actions? tl;dr - It's a sticky matter. Make sure you have your facts straight, and don't hold them to an abnormally high standard solely because you happen to have knowledge of things they do that you don't necessarily approve of as a person. Remember that they're human, that your other employees probably do many of the same things, and a given person can't control what others put online."
341,"I disagree with this sentence: Even in good times lay offs of people can happen for extreme poor performance or disciplinary issues. And thinking this way is probably why you aren't sure how to run a layoff. When people perform extremely poorly or have disciplinary issues, and you decide to terminate their employment, that's not a layoff. You fired them. A layoff is when there is just not the money (usually because there's not the work) to support the people you have. It typically happens in three stages, all optional: Identify a large category (the Swindon office, the graphic arts department, the 3rd floor) that is costing more than it brings in and that you will simply close. You won't be doing that activity any more. Identify particular individuals you want to ""rescue"" from that decision and bring to a part of the company that is staying open. Identify particular individuals from the part of the company that is staying open who need to go, in order to make room for the ones you are keeping from the closed part. This may be complicated if the ones you want to keep decline your offer of a new work location or responsibilities - you can't always be sure at the start how many need to go in this step. Another pattern is that you don't close some part of the company, instead you shrink the workforce by a certain number of people or a certain total payroll, so you just do step 3 above. There are three ways to choose who goes in step 3 (and possibly who is saved in step 2): mechanically based on time with the company. Most recently hired is first to go. People often think this is the fairest, but it's often not best for the company keep the most versatile people (even if they're not the highest performers) so you can still offer your existing services with a smaller team keep the best performers It's important for your staff to know that a person chosen for layoff is almost never a poor performer. Firing poor performers is an easy way to save money and has usually been done before layoffs start. They might be an ok performer who is just not the best. They might be the best at something the company isn't going to do any more. They might be the best, but only at one thing and now the company needs people who are ok-or-better at two things. It's up to you whether you tell anyone the reasons for your choice. I found the sentence ""we chose who to layoff based on the mix of work expected in the coming months"" made people feel better without encouraging them to come and argue about it."
342,"How, as an intern or summer student, do you deal with a situation where you are denied opportunities because of your temporary status?. I've worked in a number of internship/summer roles/student schemes and one problem I have come across is that often, opportunities including interesting tasks and training courses are denied to students because ""you're not here long enough"" (which includes year-long internships). A very trivial example of this experience - at one of my former employers I was involved in some chemical work. Testing equipment regularly used a compound called Methyl Salicylate in small, controlled, non-toxic (i.e. not pure) doses. However, I was not allowed to use this, instead being limited to only using water. The reason for this was, apparently, safety and training for the correct handling of the compound required time with other members of staff at the company, which the company were unwilling to spend. Another, more common example includes being denied access to training courses. I realise that, as an enterprise, a company wishes to make investments such as training opportunities in staff that have accepted permanent contracts, rather than temporary ones; however, if you're part of a company for a year-long internship, I can't help but feel I am also entitled to some (reasonable) development investment. Am I right? Obviously, you have to be reasonable in what you are asking, but assuming the company regularly offers training schemes and progression opportunities to full time employees, assuming the task, course or opportunity is relevant or useful to the company and my role, is the fact that I am employed on a fixed term contract a sufficient reason to say no. If so, how does one approach their employer, manager etc and ask to be considered for these opportunities where relevant? Is there anything specific you can do to make your case?"
343,When is it more appropriate to use a résumé versus a CV?. This English and Language question answers what makes a résumé different from a curriculum vitae (CV). But when is it more appropriate to use one over the other? Are there industries that expect one and not the other? Is a CV more common outside the US?
344,Yes.  Companies are often unwilling to invest time and training on employees that are not going to stick around. As an intern you are being brought in to help get some practical experience.  The company needs to manage its workforce and liabilities.  You should not expect the company to treat you like an employee because you are not. What you can do is develop a relationship with your supervisor.  If you are interested in getting full time work with the company let them know and find out how to maximize your chance of getting hired on.  You will find the companies are more willing to train assets that they feel they will benefit from later.
345,"Reference from previous Job. Generally potential employees are asked to give references from their previous job.  If the last job didn't end on a good note, is it acceptable to say no to providing references? If not, what is the best thing to do in this case?"
346,"There are many different kinds of gossip and they aren't all wrong. Gossip is how a culture establishes its norms. When someone tells you I saw Steve in the caf talking to Joe from another group, and they looked embarrassed and went quiet when they were spotted , they are telling you that leaving this group, especially stealthily, is against the group norms, or that secret conversations are against the group norms. That kind of gossip has its place. On the other hand if they're telling you I saw Steve at a restaurant last night talking to a woman who wasn't his wife, and they looked embarrassed and went quiet when they were spotted , that is not good gossip. I would reply ""I can think of a thousand innocent reasons you would see that, and I can't think of a single reason we should be discussing it."" Lumping both conversations, along with I heard there might be more layoffs coming and The new XZ123 Mark IV is really spiffy, I can't wait till it's released as gossip is throwing away valuable information and not being hard enough on the personal prying and judging that constitutes bad gossip."
347,"You can be honest about why you'd rather not provide references. If you DO say, up front, why you're not providing them, at least that avoids them ""filling in the blank"" on their own. Many company's policies are that personal references are not allowed, do there's always the ""give them the number to HR"" reference, but that's not really a character reference at all, which is what most people are looking for. It's a tradeoff any way you look at it. One bad experience isn't going to kill your career or resume. It might be a bump in the road, but just keep moving, and make sure to learn from your past experience (i.e. make an active effort to make sure your next reference is a good one). Often times when a previous job's reference would be a bad reference, for example if I'd been fired from my previous position, there were probably opportunities that I passed up to have had an open conversation with my supervisor that would have led me to leave on my own before things went bad, and therefore resulting in a reference that would have been at least fair and level headed, rather than poor because I waited to be fired before leaving."
348,To the interviewer the fact that you don't provide references from the last job could be a Big Red Flag.  The thought process when someone refuses to give references from their last position means that there was a conflict between this employee and the rest of the team that noone will give him or her the reference.  This also means that this potential employee will have the same conflict in the new job so it might be better to simply pass on this candidate.
349,"I would look at the review criteria, and take the time now (several weeks before the review) to schedule a meeting with your supervisor about what the criteria mean to them, and to get examples of behaviors that score highly. The best source of information on how to increase your score will always be from the people providing the score. Taking the initiative to schedule a meeting yourself weeks (or better yet, months ahead of time) will not only look good, it will give you time to make changes based on the feedback you get in order to score better than you would have otherwise. Basically, it never hurts to ask, and starting an open dialog is pretty much always a good thing to do."
350,"Human resources is the set of individuals who make up the workforce of an organization, business sector or an economy. ""Human capital"" is sometimes used synonymously with human resources, although human capital typically refers to a more narrow view; i.e., the knowledge the individuals embody and can contribute to an organization. Likewise, other terms sometimes used include ""manpower"", ""talent"", ""labor"" or simply ""people""."

352,"This tag can be used when one is trying to improve their standing in their current career. This tag can be put on questions regarding being promoted to a higher position, or on questions about any training related to broadening one's skill set through training  in order to improve their chances at getting a promotion. This tag can also apply to questions about writing a cover letter or CV when one is trying to get a new job that is a step up from their current job. E.g questions about writing a CV when trying to get a job as a manager when you are currently a developer."
353,Questions relating to advancing one's career; this could include questions about promotions and training or looking for a job outside of the current company
354,"Pretty much everyone who has an online persona has something that a potential employer could object to. Much of which is information that is illegal for you to use in hiring decisions. From their online persona, you can often deduce someone's religious beliefs, political beliefs, race, age, sex. You can also see things that were maybe posted years earlier and the person has matured and would no longer do or say such things (especially things from high school and college). Some of the data may be associated with the wrong person. And some things that are positives (like a high Stack Overflow rep) may be negatives to other employers because the data is interpreted differently by different people. Asking for my password to see my private persona is completely out of bounds and would immediately terminate an interview because I would not work for a company that was that unethical. Looking a the public persona is acceptable, but it is far more likely to harm the company than help it as they might elimnate the best potential employees based on personal criteria of the person doing the checks. So while I may not be able to ask if you are a liberal athiest in  an interview, if I can see it from your public persona, then I might choose not to hire you even though you are far better than the other candidates. And remember the people doing this check may not be the people who work with the person daily. So their refusal to hire anyone not conspicously like themselves can cause corporate harm (choosing less skilled employees) in the name of promoting some personal value. Practices that lead to eliminating people based on criteria not related to their ability to the do job are wrong and should be prohibited. Checking the online persona is one of these practices. It's sole purpose is to get around labor laws that forbid asking those questions. In general it is an unethical practice."
356,"In the banking industry in the US, letting your boss know you are looking for another job can get you fired immediately. One bank I worked for monitored phone lines (and bathrooms) and if you were overheard to be looking for another job, the security department would have your boss and an armed guard at your desk the next morning to help you pack your things and leave. While this bank is an outlier, the doctrine of "" at will employment "" in the US means that giving your employer ""too much notice"" can result in you being fired. In the US, 2 weeks notice is customary when resigning. It is reasonably common enough that when you give your notice that you will be immediately escorted from the premises, so that informing supervisors that you are ""looking"" can be very risky. It is my experience in the US that you should have all your personal possessions out of the office before giving notice."
357,"Starting a new job can be an exciting, nerve-racking and even awkward experience no matter how many times you've done it before. Questions might focus around how to bring yourself in line with existing practices, or how to incorporate your own ideas to an existing workplace. There may be questions about HR and new practices or contracts there. Questions can focus on any aspect of starting or looking for a new job."
358,"Questions about starting a new job, the etiquette required, and potential pitfalls involved."
359,"As a motorcyclist, for almost all of the interviews I have attended in the last 10 years I have worn a collared shirt and either smart black jeans or black leather trousers , and have never suffered for it. In the early days of my career I would take a suit with me, arrive early and change when I got there. Usually though, arriving early just seemed to annoy interviewers. Later I started arriving on time and asking the interviewer if they would like me to change, the theory being that they would understand the impracticality of riding a motorcycle in a suit, yet still appreciate me going to the effort. I never once had an interviewer say yes. Since then I've taken the attitude that if smart casual isn't good enough, then I probably wouldn't fit in very well anyway, and this has served me well. Also, if like me you do not feel comfortable in a suit, the value of fitting in might be outweighed by the adverse effects of wearing the suit on your interview performance. For me, just wearing a tie can put me ill at ease . Even so, if I turn up to interview and everyone is wearing a tie, I might excuse myself for a moment and don the tie I brought with me, just in case . Ultimately, if you look businesslike and feel confident , it probably doesn't matter for a technical job, unless you are trying to get into a very formal/conservative environment."
360,"Dealing with someone who thinks he's ""divinely right"". I have recently come across the situation where I have to deal with the person (software architect) who seem to think that the software solution he had come up with is basically ""divinely correct"" and can be applied for every situation.  Without going into too much details on what the solution is, we have done quick analysis of applying the solution to the problem at hand and came away with more questions and problems that I care to list in the question, yet this person persists with applying the solution. Some of the first attempts to utilize the solution this person come up with produced Rube Goldberg's machines which had been shown to run measurably slower then the previous solutions (no matter how outdated and badly written). What is basically comes back from this person when questions begin to be asked is: ""This is the way I have decided to do it and this is what we will do!"" How do you deal with a person like this?"
361,"This tag applies to questions about how one is perceived in the working environment For example, a question about leaving an interview early would have this tag as it encompasses how you are viewed professionally. Not surprisingly what is considered professional is dictated by your profession. So what is considered to be professional for a builder may vastly differ from what is professional for a secretary."
362,Questions referring to how one presents themselves and interacts with others in a professional environment
363,"Unless you burned your bridges with a flamethrower, there is usually SOMEONE at an old job who would say something nice about you. It will be a bit of a red flag if the person you offer up is only vaguely related to your job function and/or isn't a supervisor, but a weak reference is usually better than none at all."
364,"Communicating long term goals without seeming overly ambitious. I take a lot of inspiration from one of the Directors I have worked with in the past. I wish to transition into such a position in the future. However this is still a long way ahead and I see a lot of room for improvement. When asked in an interview what my long term (5+) goals were, I mentioned that I would ideally like to become a Director in my areas of competency. The interviewer who was really being a good listener until that point moved on to next question without a chance for me to elaborate. I felt that this must be because of the way I told him about what I wanted to become. So I must ask if there is a better way to communicate your long term goals."
365,The thing you can do is talk with him in group about it. If this is a shared effort then you need to see what other people think about his solution and if there is a better alternative. If you feel the quality of his solution isn't good enough and would make your customer unhappy or jeopardize your project. Take it up with your teamleader or boss. Explain to them why you think his solution isn't correct. Show your alternative. However if you are the only one on your team that thinks he's wrong then you will have to go with the flow I'm afraid.
366,"Handling Credit-takers. How should I handle colleagues, especially seniors/superiors, who generally do not contribute much towards a project, but jump in from nowhere at the correct time to take credit?"
367,"In many places, a reference doesn't necessarily have to be from your last job, it could be from a previous job. If you are still employed, you can even use the justification that you don't want to warn your current employer that you are looking for another job. If not, you can still claim that a previous employer could provide a more objective assessment, especially if you are in the middle of claim for unfair dismissal. Finally, in litigious locations, employers are often reticent to provide references which include anything other than verifiable fact . In many cases they will refuse to confirm anything other than the dates you worked there, since even saying how many sick days you took could be considered disclosure of private information and open them up to the risk of a libel case."
368,"I think you're over-thinking it. From an interviewer's standpoint, there's really any number of reasons you could transition from one question to another, including the idea that you felt the person answered the question very satisfactorily. Without direct feedback on your performance (from the person observing and reacting to the behavior), you can't worry about trying to read their mind. If you feel comfortable asking for feedback (and especially do this any time you get hired at a job - follow up with the recruiter/employee who interviewed you on what went well, and take notes), then absolutely ask for feedback. Don't try to read minds."
369,"It depends on the situation and anyone that tells you otherwise is likely over generalizing the industry. On one extreme you are going to run into companies that will promptly tell you to go home if you are under dressed, but these are rare and the average person is not going to run into just as a matter of course. On the other hand you are going to run into companies that will give you an immediate down vote just for wearing a suit to an interview with them; however, my own experience here is that you are more likely to encounter a personal bias from the interviewer as opposed a full blown company culture against suits. In general practice you are going to be best served by ensuring that you appear to have put thought into appearance that day, if only as recognition of the situation and as a courtesy to others. Baring extremes on one end of the spectrum or the other, you are unlikely going to have a negative reaction if you are wearing a well fitted suit to the interview, although if the suit fits poorly (i.e. the suit is wearing you as opposed to the other way around) it can reflect negatively. Generally when I go in for an interview I've always worn a suit or slacks and a sport coat and the only exception thus far being when I interviewed with a start-up and found out they were biased against suits before hand and ""dressed down"" by wearing slacks and a dress shirt. Don't forget that when interviewing you are also interviewing the company as well though and the appearance of the people interviewing you also says something. Personally I find it a touch disrespectful to be interviewed by someone wearing shorts and a pair of saddles and one should expect the people interviewing you to dress a touch better than they normally would as a matter of courtesy and respect as well."
370,"The important thing to get across to people is that as an intern you are already costing them a lot of money, so the extra cost of a little training could be small compared to value they gain in the short term from you having had that training. Using your example, if providing you with Methyl Salicylate handling training would mean that you could take the load off a permanent employee who is currently over-stretched, or allow someone else to provide even more business value than they are currently providing, you might be able to convince them to authorise the training. As with many things in business, you have to provide a business case for anything you want to spend company money on. You may not have all of the figures needed for a full cost-benefit analysis, but just having the discussion with your manager/mentor could be all that is needed to find other areas where a business case could be argued."
371,"There's a difference between 'taking credit' and 'getting credit.'  The way to combat those that Take it is to Get it.  You get credit by continuing to do good work, documenting your contributions, communicating effectively and gradually increasing the scope of your influence and responsibilities.  People who are in a position to Give credit should eventually see your contributions and provide the feedback you're looking for. For example, if you're working on Project X and a notorious credit stealer is responsible for attending a status meeting on behalf of the team, see if you can volunteer to also attend the meeting and provide your own status.  Or further, you can volunteer to take over the responsibilities of attending the meeting under the guise of 'professional advancement.' The last thing you want to do is try and make a public spectacle of the situation as it makes you look petty and has the exact opposite impact you're hoping for."
372,"If that person has the decision-making power, then that's that. If it's not meeting with the customer's requirements (i.e. the customer disagrees that the solution meets their requirements) then they don't necessarily have to pay for it (unless a contract says otherwise), and they can say something as simple as, ""Ok, I hear why you want to go this way, but that doesn't solve the problem that I need the [software/product/solution] to solve."" Egos run high. This is part of any workplace. When it comes to engineer types, you can try to present objective, measurable performance and quality metrics (if that applies in your situation) - engineers (at least generally) will respond to reasoned arguments. If that fails, then you have to consider who actually has the decision making power, whether or not this is a fight worth fighting, and how it will impact your customers and business. I don't think it hurts to make your concerns known, so long as it is a reasoned, objective point of view, and not a personal attack on the engineer. All that being said, what we don't see from your question is the engineer's point of view - perhaps you're wrong on this one, perhaps you're not - it's hard to make a determination without knowing both sides."
373,"How to communicate long term goals without seeming overly ambitious? normalocity's advice is what I would have said for your specific case; normally, when interviewing asking such a question is not so much to hear a detailed plan of your future, but to ascertain that you are thinking in and interested in developmening. More generally, I would use a few guiding principles: Be selective about the long term goals you have; ultimately, not all of them are compatible with the company and you should avoid mentioning these. In contrast  - do absolutely bring up those to which your opportunity would contribute and more to the point highlight this fact. Be prepared to talk honestly about your goals. Have goals in the first place by preparing. In short, do not avoid communicating your goals by saying something like ""I do not have any"". Be realistic about your goals and their timeframe. Nothing wrong with being ambitious; for example, it's perfectly acceptable to say ""I would like, eventually, to work at directorship level, but clearly I need first to gain some interesting experience"". In short, what you're doing here is selectively presenting goals which are well planned goals - i.e. those laid out carefully against guidelines such as SMART . Chances are, if your goals follow such principles, you will not come across as over ambitious."
374,"There are two kinds of references - personal references and those of former supervisors. When you create a personal reference list, you should be looking for the people who are most likely to say something good about you. You have much less choice about listing former supervisors and their contact information. If the former supervisor has moved on, you can list the name and point out that you have lost contact with this person over time and do not know how to contact them. If he still works at the company, this will be revealed as a lie, so don't try it then. Being caught in a lie is the single worst thing you can do in looking for a new position. If you have a former supervisor who will have something negative to say, first be aware that many companies do not let their supervisors give out more than dates of work at the particular place. If you were fired for cause, then they may say that as well, but they may not. If you want to find out what the person would say, then have someone you know call and pretend to be the HR person of a company who is checking your references. At least then you will know how serious the problem could be. If you were fired and you know the person will give a poor reference, then the best strategy is to address that up front. Explain why you were fired, what you learned from it and why you don't think this will be a problem in a future job. It is most effective though if you have other strong references (from other supervisors not just co-workers) that you can point to. This kind of thing can follow you around for a long time, so be very careful of how you leave a company in the future. In the software industry, you have the opportunity to spend time working as a freelancere and then have client references that you can point to instead. This can get you past the time when the old poor reference would be most damaging."
375,"For you first job it can be quite important if you want to land a position with a high profile company, but then they are also going to be looking at interns that have worked for them in the past so GPA might not be as significant a factor as one might think. After you start having companies that you can list on your CV it starts to mean even less and arguably you should drop it from your CV when you add your first ""real"" job as that is what you will be judged on going forward. Likely the only exception that is somewhat related to the GPA is I would leave any Latin honors received on the CV as it tends to speak more than just a raw number would."
376,"Are technical assessments appropriate for interviews?. At our company, i've written an exam that provides relative technical assessment. The test questions range from simple to difficult. Is it appropriate to provide compulsory technical examination for a technical candidate? If so should it be written or orally executed?"
377,"I would shy away from a test.  Writing a test that intelligently evaluates a candidate's knowledge, and avoids trivia is hard.  And I've heard that some really good developers do poorly on such tests. What I like to do when interviewing candidates is ask to rate them to rate themselves on a scale of 1-10 on all the relevant technologies they'll be using if hired.  Then I take whatever technologies they rated themselves the highest in, and I just chat with them about it, and make sure they have a good understanding. If they rate highly JavaScript, then I'll ask them about closures, how the this value works, etc.  If they rate highly in Entity Framework, I'll ask if they understand the steps needed to avoid superfluous database calls, select N + 1, intelligently abstracting the data layer, and so on."
378,"I've been given an exam in lieu of a phone screen, and I've also been given a short-answer quiz. A short-answer quiz (about 5-7 questions) is a good idea.  It's basically a phone screen but in paper form, and it might save you some time.  You can give it to weed out people who don't know anything, or like to make stuff up."
379,"Yes It provides an additional, objective input to the selection process.  And it can save time, because some candidates will just give up and go home. And although I am not a lawyer , I think it is a good idea to have a standard test given to all candidates.  The written test results can help defend against a discrimination complaint from a rejected candidate.  On the other hand, evidence goes both ways, so you probably want to seek counsel before creating any discoverable documents. Write your own test, with long-form answers, rather than using a multiple-guess exam from BrainBench or similar services.  A skilled test taker can do well on a multiple-choice exam with no prior knowledge."
380,"Make sure the credit for the work you do is coming to you. You don't need to be a glory seeker, just stand up for yourself. If the person who is claiming credit is speaking outright lies, do what you think is right given the situation. Regardless of what happens, you need to be working in a place where you feel that what is right is the thing that usually wins, whatever the method or culture in your workplace. When you stick up for what you think is right, there will, of course, be consequences. Usually you'll find that those consequences either encourage others to speak out against something that they also think is wrong, or it gives you the feedback and direction you need to know that maybe you want to work in a company culture that's different than your current assignment. Company cultures are as diverse as the people who work within them, so there's plenty of choices."
381,"I prefer a hands on technical assessment.  It is more important to see how the problem was solved than that the problem is solved.  I would rather have a ""wrong"" answer that was achieved through a good method than a ""Correct"" answer that came from memory."
382,"How do you approach imparting technical knowledge to your superiors?. The people who are in charge of my workplace don't really understand what computers are capable of, mistrust them, and generally have a great deal of difficulty using technology. This is a problem because our work now requires us to handle huge databases, and data storage and management is one of our major problems as a firm. As a result of their confusion, they tend to make uninformed decisions that lead to major headaches for everyone, or they simply fail to use the system effectively. They aren't particularly receptive to the idea of training, as they're very busy, and informal explanations of how our systems work don't seem to stick. Are there some tips on imparting technological basics to your superiors in an inoffensive (but hopefully effective) way?"
383,"The only quick solution I have found in these situations is to find a new situation.  You are dealing with organizational insanity, and you won't be able to fix it anytime soon.  The wrong person has been promoted and his management doesn't seem to know or care.  You do not have enough influence to effect a change, and technical arguments will not work . The alternative is to go along with the ineffective process and bide your time.  Eventually the cost overruns will force someone to take notice.  The architect will be encouraged to do something else.  If you have stayed around, cooperating and winning friends, maybe you will be the next architect. BTW, I left a very similar situation five years ago.  The incompetent technical leaders were replaced last year."
386,"If your ""nickname"" is what EVERYONE, even strangers, calls you (for example it says Katherine on my birth certificate but I go by Kate) just do all your interactions with the company using that name (fill out the application form if there is one, sign your cover letter and so on.) Then where necessary mention your other name - for example that a university degree was earned under that more formal name. I occasionally have to ask a client who is buying a plane ticket to buy it for Katherine Gregory so the ticket will match the passport. If your ""nickname"" is what your friends call you, and you don't expect strangers, even those who work in the same company, to use it, then wait until you are hired and invite people to call you it if you like. If you want all your coworkers to use it, wait for the first person to either greet you, or introduce you to someone else, and say ""I go by animuson actually"" and then that person will introduce you to everyone that way. If during the interview process you're more comfortable being called by the nickname, but for some reason you applied as LongName, when it's your turn the person will say ""good morning, you're LongName?"" and you'll say ""yes, though in person I prefer to go by animuson"" and they will make a note on their notes and you're all set."
387,"Bruce Webster coined the phrase "" thermocline of truth "" to describe situations like this. Eliminating the ""information sink"" requires political and managerial help from above the point where truth stops flowing uphill."
388,"Generally, GPA is something one would only include on resumes for the first 1 or 2 jobs out of school, and only if it is very good. There is a dissertation that I think may be relevant: Hiring and inequality in elite professional service firms (by Lauren Rivera). Your university library should be able to obtain a copy. I think it is one of the few sociological studies that actually measures what recruiters (in that tier of company) are actually looking for - as compared to what they say they are looking for. In general, partners and staff at the ""elite"" service firms look upon a high GPA as a proxy measure for ""how meticulous"" you are. Someone with a 4.0 would be perceived as ""very meticulous"" while someone with a 2.5 might be intelligent, might get the job done, but would be perceived as ""careless""."
389,"I've seen it done a couple of different ways - recruiters asking me to go take a BrainBench exam and having to do hands-on exercises at an interview. IMO, seeing someone code / whiteboard / design something (or on the flip side, having to do that stuff), really says a lot more about the candidates skill set than a resume or cover letter will.  I'd rather see how someone thinks and approaches a problem.  As a developer, I'm really not interested in how well your resume is written - it just needs to convince me that you can do the job I need done. I'm interested in seeing how a candidate approaches a problem and thinks on their feet.  Yeah, interviews are stressful and lots of people have problems in them, but you can make allowances for that.  I don't expect someone to come in and ace the interview - it's hard because I want to hire the top 10% (or 5%) of developers.  I want the candidate to walk out of there knowing that they had a hard, but fair interview.  I want them to want to come work for us, not just a ""yeah, I could work there"", but a ""man, that would be an awesome place to work""."
390,"Training would be the best option, but failing that, is it possible to set up some sort of ""Tech tip of the week"" email, where once a week you email out a well-written tip/tutorial for some of the specific systems you are using? You'd have to make sure the tips are relevant, positive, and emphasize the benefits of following them. I know here they did that when they migrated to Outlook, way back whenever that was, and even I learnt some neat tricks I'd never heard of before."
391,"How can I become a team person?. I have worked in environments where I was either an individual contributor or a lone techie without much need for team effort. As I go further in my career, I find it necessary to branch out to positions which have more structured teams and need a significant amount of team effort. I also believe that this is a vital career development effort a person can put forth to happen upon better opportunities. Neither is this a question about how to become a team-lead nor am I looking to find out how to acquire leadership skills. I am interested in learning how to become a team contributor, what ways one can become more involved, and how to become an effective participant in team efforts."
392,"From my experience: Feedback is alaways good. Ask other members of your team how can you help, request opinions and criticism etc... Be prepared for harsh comments that might happen; eventually you will learn to ignore or to make something positive out of them. The reverse is also true: give feedback. Encourage people to come to you and talk about their issues. Get everybody to be a voice and participate in decisions. Always try and find something positive about someone's work, then use this as an starting point on how his/her work can be improved. Always be honest and open with issues, but without pointing fingers or being condescending. Also, do not argue for the sake of it. Do not be afraid to speak up if someone is doing something wrong, time-wasting, hurtful (i.e. off-color humour, misbehaviour towards other people etc..) or harmful. Be patient, understanding and tolerant - develop those skills, not only for team work, they're useful for pretty much everywhere."
393,"From, ""The Fast Forward MBA in Project Management,"" it provides a great list of essential qualities of being a team player: Listen actively. Ask questions. Give constructive feedback. Don't express an opinion as a fact explain your reasons. Awareness of body language and tone. Appropriate humor. Develop rapport with your team members. Patience."
394,"What do I take from a ""demotion"" that doesn't change my title or pay?. After getting a customer complaint (the only one I had in two and a half years), I was promptly ""demoted."" The upper management kept referring to it as a ""demotion"" and it kind of was since they were forbidding me from doing a lot of things that I would normally do as a supervisor, basically knocking me down to a regular employee. However, my title and pay did not change as a result of this. My name tag still said ""supervisor"" and I was still given keys. What do I take from this / what does it mean? Do they not have a real reason to demote me and just don't like me?"
395,"How long can I wait to respond to a job offer?. Possible Duplicate: How to coordinate the process of pursuing multiple job opportunities at the same time? I've applied for three companies (we'll call them A, B, and C). Company A has moved the application process along quickly and I can expect an offer by Friday. Company B is moving fairly quickly, too, but I'll be doing the in-person interview the middle of this week. Company C is a little behind (both due to their speed, and the timing in which I contacted them), and my in-person interview isn't until Monday. All three companies look promising, and I expect to get an offer from at least Company B, as well, but it will likely be early next week before I hear back. They're also all companies that I think I would enjoy working at, given the knowledge I have, and compensation is pretty equal. Since I can expect my first offer on Friday, and a second one on Monday or Tuesday, how long is considered acceptable before responding with a ""yes"" or ""no"" to a job offer? Is waiting until I at least have my in-person interview with Company C too long to make Company A wait? Or should I cancel my interview with Company C and simply consider A or B, to speed up my response time?"
396,"Lots of things to say here. First and probably the most important if you have been working on your own, your ideas are not the only good ones. Further, rarely in a career do you join a team that is starting to build something new from scatch with no decisions made prior to your arrival. Expect that there will be decisons made about tools, architecture, techniques, standards that you don't agree with. Sometimes these descisions were made years earlier and are not subject to change as too much code would have to change to do so. The person new to the team must first establish a reputation as someone who can accomplish things before trying to change the team or the way they do business. Until you have the respect of your peers and supervisors, you cannot effectively manage change. So when you first join a team, learn what they do and how they do it and establish yourself as a team player and valuable employee before trying to make people do things the way you want to. I bring this up because usually this is the first issue people face when starting to work as a team, the loss of total control over what tools they use, how the software is architected and how to write code. For instance if the team has a coding standard (which may or may not be formally written (but is generally apparent from the existing code when it is is informal), then follow it even if you don't like it.  These standards make it easier for people to understand code they didn't write, so follow them. Insisting on doing this sort of stuff your way is the fast track to people not wanting to work with you. Be aware that the time to argue for a change or a diffeernt way of doing things is before the decision has been made. You will get your chance later, have some patience at first. Now how to get that respect and become a team player. First, do the tasks you are assigned to do and do them on time as much as possible and as well as the enviroment will allow you to. If you have meetings where software decisions are discussed (A planning meeting for a new project for instance), speak up with your ideas, but also listen respectfully to the ideas of others. Talk to your team mates. Remeber that they may not have seen your resume and thus don't know what experience you have that might be valuable to them, so if you have expertise in something that is clearly on the horizon and someone else is stumped, offer some advice. But do it carefully, don't come off as a know-it-all. Compliments to others can go a long way towards them accepting you as a part of the team. But make them genuine, people can spot a phony compliment a mile away. Offer to do some of the tasks that are unpopular. Learn where everything is and how to do most common tasks. Become the go-to person for domain knowledge or even how to submit a help desk request. Take on the hard tasks if you feel you have the programming chops to do them, but don't be surprised if you have to prove yourself on easier things first before being allowed to do the harder more interesting things. Be aware that you are now responsible for more than yourself. If you are having a problem and need help, ask for it. Don't let the team down by hiding problems or by pretending you are going to meet a deadline that you have no chance of making. If your delay will cause a delay for someone else, make sure they know well in advance. I can remember a project where we were all supposed to use something that one person was going to develop. He didn't ask questions of anyone else, he didn't let us know how he was getting along in the task and he didn't get it done which affected about 20 other things and made a lot of people certain to never recommend him or want towork with him in the future. Treat people with respect, even those you personally do not like. To get respect, you have to give respect. Learn the fine art of compromise. You can only get some of what you want by giving others some of what they want. Have a positive, can-do attitude. And then translate that can-do into did-do. Nothing makes you a more valuable team memeber than the rest of the team knowing you will deliver. Don't be defensive in code reviews (if other people will have to maintain your code and they will in a team, then they have a right to ask questions and try to make your code something they can understand) and don't be personally attacking when you do them for other people. Keep things professional."
397,"I don't want to put you on the spot, but it would be very difficult to say, without knowing more details, such as the nature of the mistake, its perceived severity, the result and impact of the mistake on the customer and company, etc. Since I don't want you to bear your soul to everyone, I would advise you to speak to your supervisor and ask what the plan is, how this will affect you, and most importantly, how you can correct/avoid the mistake and regain the trust. it may turn out that this is part of documenting the issue, which is important to affecting any changes that they feel might need to take place. Ultimately, you just need to bring it up, be receptive and non-defensive regarding whatever feedback might come your way, with the goal of finding out what you can do about it. Whatever you do, don't sit and wonder. Take some action, and if you feel you're in the dark, ask the right questions to get some light shed on the situation.  I don't want to try to explain the behavior of your supervisor, because there isn't enough information, and everyone's approach is different when working with team members that make mistakes."
398,"First be grateful they didn't reduce your pay. What to take from it is that you messed up but not so badly that you can't be put back into your previous level of trust.  The key is to take responsibility for whatever happened and look for ways to change to ensure it doesn't happen again. The worst thing to do is to think, ""it wasn't my fault and they are out to get me"" and theerfore to whine about how bad things are. Your attitude speakes volumes here. It is possible to get demoted and be repromoted in the same organization. It just happened where I work in fact. It is also possible to move on and get promoted elsewhere. Your career isn't ruined and you have the chance to grow professionally from this."
399,"The key point here is to be honest with companies about your interviews and offers elsewhere. Concealing this information doesn't really help anyone, and any reasonable employer should know that people pursue multiple prospects at once. With that in mind, when you get offers from A and B you should ask how long you have to decide. Employers are generally aware of this type of question and usually have an answer ready based on their current interview and hiring schedules. So, assuming you get an offer from Company A on Friday, and they give you longer than the weekend to decide, you can safely go to your interview with Company C. Company C may very well ask you what other interviews and offers you have on the table, and if they don't you can bring it up. Knowing your situation with Companies A and B will prompt Company C to either make you an offer within the current time frame of Company A, or tell you that they can't make a decision that quickly. Any company may ask you to make a decision more quickly than you're comfortable with. Some companies may also ask you to ask another company to push their deadline back. These are decisions you will have to make yourself based on your own judgments. In the end, being forward and honest with your interviewers will help you and them to schedule interviews and offers in a timely manner."
400,"How can I monitor my own DoD security clearance?. In the Washington, DC area, having a security clearance is a prerequisite for many jobs, but the actual ""holding"" of the clearance seems to always be the province of the company for which one works.  If I was interested in becoming my own company, how could I go about holding my own clearance and maintaining it? What forms do I need, what processes do I need to go through?"
401,"First you have to become aware that working more than 40 hours a week is not productive over the long term. First, you get physically exhausted and it will take longer to get work accomplished than if you refreshed yourself. Further, it will affect your health and probably fairly soon. Also, it disguises the need for more people to carry the load to higher management. The only way to get more people is to not be able to handle the load. Working too much voluntarily is also a great way to hide from yourself when other parts of your life are not working. It is an excuse not to try . (Not to try to have a boyfriend, not to try to write a novel, not to try to make new friends, not to try to fix your marriage, not to try to improve your child rearing, etc.) It means you need to look at your own priorities and find out what is really bothering you about your life and fix that."
402,"The trouble is that a security clearance is always tied to a specific need to access classified material. To my knowledge there is no way to just have a security clearance without have a specific job or contract where you are required to use it. It doesn't work like a technical certification where you pass a test and it is tied to you individually for a period of time regardless of whether you need it. If you are moving from one contract or employer to another those clearances can be transferred, but technically your employer is required to notify the agency issuing the clearance within a prescribed amount of time to either transfer it to your new employer or cut it off. So to more directly answer your question: First your company would need a contract with an agency that required you to have a clearance to do the work. Then you would need to work with them to sponsor your clearance. Long story short: You can't just get a standard form and apply for a clearance for no reason. You need an Government agency to sponsor your efforts and a good business case for why you need the clearance."
403,"The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) is the database that stores information about clearances. It's managed by the Defense Manpower Data Center. They have contact information and regulation about obtaining access, but it appears that you need to have a position that requires you to hold a job that requires you to access the database and its records. An individual can not request access to JPAS on his own, but must go through the Facility Security Officer (FSO). It's up to the FSO to monitor the clearances of the individuals who require (or no longer require) them and the individual to monitor when you received your clearance, when it expires, and properly submit any paperwork regarding status changes that impact your clearance. You might be interested in the Defense Security Service website , which should have some documents available to the general public about DoD security clearance. The Frequently Asked Questions about the Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Process page should address most of your concerns."
404,"I'm going to take one point out of your question and address that: This is a problem because our work now requires us to handle huge
  databases, and data storage and management is one of our major
  problems as a firm. What you need to do to fix this problem and others like it is to learn to communicate in business speak not technical speak to your bosses. They are making bad decisions because they don't have the right info or understand the information they have. But they do understand cost-benefit analysis and financial talk. So first, pick a db issue that needs to be solved. Then come up with several factors that need to be used to evaluate the solution. They should include things like initial cost, maintenance cost,  security, time to install (or get the project complete), customer satisfaction, etc. Some should be easily quantified and others can and should be more subjective. Next (and this is the sneaky part), get the managers to order those factors in importance with an actual number from 1-5. Now you take that and you create a matrix with several possibilities including the one you are pushing for. Rate each possibility from 1-5 for each factor. Multiply each rating by the importance factor and add up the values for each possibility. If you have done this correctly, the best solution will appear by having the highest score and likely it will be yours. Managers love this because it allows them to point to something ""Objective"" to say they made the right decision. You will love it because you can use it to show your solution is better according to the very things they have agreed are of the most importance. And you don't have to explain why fgh is better than ghi technically because you have explained why in business terms."
406,"I'm going to provide two perspectives to this. The first is that part of my dream job would involve sitting a test. The role has a highly mathematical element and the test is there to ensure basic competencies needed to do the job. This is ok, since a test can show this - can a candidate perform to a strict minimum level. However, I am also a software engineer, and for these kind of roles I do not think a technical test in an interview is a good idea. For starters, all decent software engineers can pick up any language they so desire and should be able to research and solve problems. That's what you'll be doing on the job and it's hard to write a test that covers those competencies. Instead, I much prefer an interviewer set me a problem to complete before interview. It shouldn't be too big, but it should show my ability to code out a solution to a problem. It also reduces the number of people you need to invite to you for assessment, which is an expensive business. It gives you something to talk about in interviews and is somewhat self-selecting in that candidates who are not prepared to put the effort in to complete the task will not even be interviewed. Finally, this method takes the pressure off the interview and allows you to use this time for assessing interpersonal skills and other ""soft"" requirements, if you like."
407,"I have sat in this seat several times. As a result of their confusion, they tend to make uninformed decisions that lead to major headaches for everyone, or they simply fail to use the system effectively. The problem here is pretty straightforward: they tend to make uninformed decisions Firstly, I'm going to assume this is the case. You have to handle this very carefully - assuming someone is incompetent when they're just busy will not endear you to them in any way. So, let's assume they're uninformed - the problem simply stated is that they need to be informed. That means somehow inserting yourself into the decision making process they undergo and listening to what they want to achieve. Then, and this is crucial - lay out all the options, presenting as simply as possible any technical concepts that you need them to know and answering any questions, then let them decide. They'll still have made the decision - they're still in charge - but you've armed them with the information they need to make the right decision. At this stage, I should say what we're trying to do is guide them, however, one thing I've taken out of doing this almost all of my working life is that sometimes when presented the options, the manager picks one for business reasons such as speed, cost etc. As IT people, particularly programmers, we tend to be set in our ways in terms of ""technologically best"", whereas the manager may see things business/strategic viewpoint. Don't begrudge them this; it's the reason we're still employed, after all. Now - how to insert yourself into the decision process? Well: ... as they're very busy Bingo. Offer to save them time. Find an example of a technical solution you think isn't the best one and contrast it with one that works, explaining how that'll save time or money (or both) all around. Then, and this is tricky - either try to offer to look at decisions, or if the manager will not let go, you can try to involve yourself in the discussion until your frequency of attendance ends up including you by default. As I say, the important aspect here, tempting as it is, is not to presume, and make the decisions. Interpret the requirements and present the options. Think ""technical liaison"". Also be aware sometimes, in some company cultures, the idea of receiving advice from junior staff doesn't really exist and you may not be able to affect the influence you need to."
408,"With regards to monitoring a security clearance, there really isn't much you can do other than noting when the various background investigations will need to be redone so you can keep your CV up to date as once the background investigation expires it loses any value when it comes to job hunting. You don't get any notification when things lapse and if you interview with someone saying that your investigation is valid and that is not the case they may not want to keep you around for a reinvestigation. When you leave the FSO may be able to provide you with a print out saying when the relevant investigations were performed for your records. From your comments to the question it sounds like you really need to be talking to the FSO and having them find out what is going. Likewise, if you are in a certain field then that may help as different agencies can help sort things out better for their own people than trying to take the general approach to the problem. In summary, if you are currently employee by someone you should talk to your FSO and work closely with them until the issue is resolved. If you aren't currently employed by someone then you are better off just indicating when the relevant investigations were conducted as a lot of issues might get cleared up just by changing sponsors."
410,What is the purpose of Six Sigma?. I have heard the term Six Sigma being used around the office and would like to understand what it means and what it is used for. Is it going to completely change the way I do my job?
411,"To measure, improve upon, and continually adjust the functioning of processes. It has its roots in manufacturing, and has a pretty thorough wikipedia article . The term itself comes from the value 99.99966%, which is the defect rate Motorola set for its production (that is, 99.99966% defect-free parts), and when applied to areas outside manufacturing, has the overall goal of reducing mistakes while improving quality. Six Sigma is seen, by some, as part of other process improvement methodologies, such as 5 Whys , continual improvement, and lean manufacturing , where the goals are to find and remove obstacles, in efficiencies, defects, mistakes, and other things that lower quality (of delivery, of products built, of parts made, etc.) and costs involved in producing something, whether that ""something"" is a physical thing, or a result from a customer service interaction, or answering a service call, or improving reliability, etc."
412,"There's a huge amount of research into how office layouts affect employee happiness and productivity, with some areas that have a consensus view, and others that don't. Some of the things that have a consensus view are that poor lighting, uncomfortable furniture and high noise levels have highly detrimental impacts on productivity (see 1 and 2 below and this very good TED Talk ). However, one of the things that has more varying conclusions is that of office layout - specifically open-plan vs private offices. The general principle seems to be thus: In jobs or industries that require high levels of short, informal and immediate interactions between people, open plan offices are more productive. In jobs or industries where high levels of focus and concentration are required, private offices work best. However, most of the studies that support open plan offices tend to have ""softer"" definitions and measures of productivity, while studies with firmer definitions and more scientific measurement practices tend to favour private offices. The biggest negative factor against open plan offices is almost always noise, and quieter open plan offices score better than loud ones. Headphones or ear plugs are also shown to help. As such, the prevailing, though not consensus view, seems to be that private offices are better (see 3 below).

413,Do employers give preference to candidates who apply in person versus online?. I often fill out applications online unless the company requires me to submit the application in person. Are there any benefits to submitting an application in person rather than filling it out online? Do companies sometimes give preference to those who apply in person?
415,"The purpose of the original 6 sigma was to improve quality of production at Motorola but has morphed into various incarnations beyond its original purpose. Will it change the way you do you job?  No You will be doing a lot more reporting learning about ""Belts"".  But in the end it will matter very little as long as what you report for 6 sigma won't produce numbers that will be far below the average that the consultants hired to introduce this into your company calculate."
416,"Should I get a contract when offered paid trial work?. I recently got an offer to do a small freelance project to display my skills and was offered some money for my effort; a flat rate upon completion. I've already talked to the company and I'm confident they have an actual interest in me so I took the project, but I agreed before requesting a contract. It does seem like a fair practice to have someone do a little work for you as an example project, so I didn't really think anything of it. After the fact I recalled many nightmare stories of freelance workers getting ripped off when they do work without a clear contract. This wasn't a major project but did require investment of my time. When I'm approached for projects like this should I request a contract upfront first? Would I risking (real) job offers by doing this? I don't want to appear rude, but I don't want to waste my time."
417,"Just from a law perspective, you should always get a contract any time there is money being provided in exchange for a service, no matter what it is. Don't end up on Judge Judy! Contracts are the easiest way to resolve any issue in an instant."
418,Are you doing anything that is cool or challenging once people know about it? Consider making a presentation about that interesting method or project at a local usersgroup meeting and then casually mention that you have an opening.
419,"I recently got an offer to do a small freelance project to display my skills and was offered some money for my effort; a flat rate upon completion. Since that was only a sample project, I don't think you really needed a contract. The fact that they paid you was a nice gesture. However, for the real job you do need a contract. Don't even start without it."
420,"I give preference to candidates who follow my instructions.  If my instructions specify online submission anyone who walks in and hands me a paper resume is probably getting scratched off the list as ""unable to follow simple instructions"". Absent specific instructions I'd say it depends on the job.  If we're talking about a secretarial/reception position a candidate who comes in dressed professionally and conducts themselves in a manner I would want representing my company will probably have a positive note scribbled on their resume and maybe a leg-up in the hiring process. If we're talking about a non customer-contact position (say a back-end software developer) where I'm going to be scrutinizing technical attributes of the resume a brief handshake and handoff probably won't make much of an impression on me either way, particularly as the interpersonal ""team fit"" part of the interview is something your peers would have to tell me about. I would definitely consider your personality as an applicant in the decision: if you want to hand in a resume in person it helps if you're the kind of applicant who can converse for a minute or two with the person you hand your resume to (it may be just pleasantries and smalltalk, or not even that at a busy office, but if you're a ""cold fish"" it might negatively impact your chances). Also consider the type of business: Selling something (cars, insurance, software, houses) is a very personal thing, and getting your face in front of the prospective employer can be a Good Thing. It should go with out saying that you should have the appearance and demeanor appropriate to an interview.  If you show up dressed well, conducting yourself professionally, and seem generally like the kind of person I'd want to work with I don't see a downside, and there's a chance it could help you out."
421,"My totally-not-a-lawyer opinion (reached after discussion with my totally-a-lawyer lawyer, back in my consulting days): Any time money is expected to change hands some kind of written agreement should be signed saying which direction the money travels, what goods/services will be received in exchange, and any other such terms as the parties may agree upon. The reason behind this is simple: You do some work for a client - say you spend a week on it -  and tell them ""It's done, that will be $500"".  Your client turns around and says ""We're paying you $50."", or ""Hey that's a great job, but it needs to do xxx - we told you that right?"".  It's hard to resolve these situations without a contract. This obviously doesn't mean you always have to charge for time/materials: You may have a zero-dollar contract for some work, or consider the investment of your time in some quick sample work as part of a proposal of sorts, but black-and-white agreements are the backbone of professional interaction, and I think they're essential if money is changing hands."
422,"Unfortunately as that English Language and Usage question mentions the terms résumé and CV have, to a degree, come to be used interchangeably in the US. Generally the only places I've encountered that truly want a CV are academic institutions (interviewing for professors/lecturers/etc.) and law firms (big cases you've argued), but your region (or prospective employer) may vary. Bottom line? If you have any doubt whether they want a summary résumé or a full CV, ask . Submitting a 10-page CV to a company that really only wants a simple one-page summary of your work experience will probably hurt your application, but a polite inquiry to the HR person (""I see you've requested my CV - just to clarify do you want the full 10 pages, or a one-page summary?"") can avoid the whole problem. There's also nothing wrong with having ""Full Curriculum Vitae available at URL "" at the bottom of your résumé."
423,"When is it appropriate to use post-nominal letters, such as degrees, in a professonal setting?. While there is a bit of a cultural distinction to be made as the treatment of post-nominal letters (e.g. Honorifics such as OBE , Esq. , or Ph.D. ; or licensure credentials such as PE ), what are some general rules that should apply for the use? Likewise, when working in an international environment, should their use be adjusted based upon who you are addressing (i.e. some writing from the United States to someone in the United Kingdom) or should you default to using the local standards?"
424,"If nobody explicitly asked you to work overtime, I'd try just limiting yourself to normal working hours and seeing if anyone remarks on it.  Make sure to have a good reason ready if they do (""I'm more productive if I can relax in the evenings"" works, as does anything family-related). If may turn into a valuable opportunity to discuss work policy/culture! (And whether it's a good idea to set unrealistic deadlines...) It's possible that nobody will mention it or complain, if you're still perceived as productive. In that case, good for you! You may even start a trend among your coworkers - perhaps most of them would like to go home earlier, but nobody wanted to be the first to do that."
426,"Yes you should. It shows you're a professional.  It gives you a chance to be very professional.  Whip up an invoice, etc. Initially it may a feel a bit 'burdensome' but after time you'll find that businesses basically expect these expenses, they're set up to do this and it's usually not the direct money of the person in front of you. Also, as voretaq7 points out they may seem like a long-lost family member when you're starting on the project but if they're not happy - even if it's because they're unreasonable, they can turn around and say we're only paying you 50% or 25% or whatever.  A contract takes uncertainty away with legal clarity."
427,"If the prospective employers think that you're worth your salt, they'll reasonably expect that you may have other options on the table. Just like with any relationship, not appearing needy is a great way to gain some leverage and operate on an even playing field. While I wouldn't suggest stalling them via deception, you could just be open and honest with prospective employers A and B and tell them that you are exploring other options, and you would like to know from them directly how long you have to make your decision. They may tell you that they'd like to know as soon as possible, or they may tell you that you have a week to decide before they extend the offer to the runner up. If you're not comfortable telling them directly that you're exploring other options, it would still be okay to ask how long you have to make the decision. Staying in communication with your prospective employer will not only set clear expectations on both ends, but you'd also be starting this new relationship on the right path by demonstrating how well you communicate with others. This will likely make them want you to accept even more. One word of caution, I wouldn't recommend asking for more than a few days to make the decision. Instead, ask them what they are comfortable with. An exception to this rule might be if you need to give your employer 3 weeks notice. If the company you're applying with is worth their salt, they should respect your intention to leave your former employer on good terms."
428,"The resume is supposed tell the recruiter whether your skills match that of the position.  While you may have some public speaking experience (from sermons, etc.), if it doesn't have anything to do with position, don't include it on your resume . 
What your passions are outside of work affect you as a person, not directly as a coder.  It is more appropriate to discuss what your passions/hobbies/interests are in the interview itself (where the objective is to get to know you on a deeper level), not the resume. Just so you know, this is coming from a person, like yourself, who likes to preach religion on the side.  There is an assumption being made (stereotype) that a ""Reverend"" is someone who is pious and has integrity.  As you may know, that may not necessarily be the case with all preachers (you know of the good ones, not everyone else, though), so a recruiter would be careful not to make that assumption as well.  So the title isn't really helping you in that regard.  And that's one facet of the issue. The fact is that it raises question marks in the recruiter's head: Is this going to be someone who's overbearing about their religion? Will they engage in debates about religion and try to proselytize people in the office? Did they apply for the right position? (Remember this is the first thing they're seeing on the resume) Are they gonna leave this day job shortly so they can pursue their real love? As for avoiding certain environments, it's your job to interview the culture/environment itself and make the decision yourself.  Don't let someone else use the title and make the choice for you, or worse (like others mentioned), use it as something to discriminate against you with."
430,"The phrase you are looking for is forms of address , and there is a huge amount of information on the subject. The sheer amount of information points to the fact that the correct form varies from honorific to honorific, country to country and setting to setting.

431,"Does 5S make sense in an office environment?. 5S is a methodology for organizing a workplace that centers on 5 concepts: Sorting: Eliminate all unnecessary tools, parts, and instructions. Anything that is not required for the current work should be stored in a designated area or discarded. Stabilizing / Straightening: Everything should have a place. The location for each item should be clearly labeled. Most used equipment should be most accessible. Equipment should be kept close to where it is used. Sweeping / Shining: Keep the workspace and equipmnt clean, tidy, and organized. Cleaning should happen on a regular (daily) basis, if not more frequently in a ""Clean as You Go"" approach. Standardizing: All work stations for a particular job should be identical. All employees doing the same job should be able to work in any station with the same tols that are in the smae location in every station. Sustaining: Main focus on the previous 4 S's. To me, all of these make sense in shared workspaces - labs are a good example. In a lab, you might have several people using the same workspace at various times. People might also use different workspaces throughout the day, depending on the task. All 5 of the S's make sense here, to make it easy for people to effectively use these spaces. However, I don't expect anyone else to use my cube or office for as long as I have it. The first three S's make sense, to some extent. I think that labeling everything might be a bit overkill, and Shining might not be as big of an issue in an office as it is in a lab. Does applying a full 5S policy make sense in an office? Are there variations on 5S that make more sense in the office?"
435,Three Primary Places. On Your Resume In your Email Signature On your Business Cards Also other places that officially identifies you such formal letterhead\ stationary that you have or a  Name plaque on your desk.
436,"I disagree entirely with the idea. When I do creative work, that's inherently messy and a requirement to keep everything spit-polished is not only ridiculous, it is counterproductive. I file visually, I can always find something in the stack on my desk but if it goes into a file folder it is lost forever. It is wasteful of  time to be forever cleaning when I could be working. Not everyone works well in neat conditions. I find them distracting and uncomfortable and I can't find what I need."
437,"I have on my business card: Kate Gregory, P.Eng, Ph.D I list them in the order I earned them. I don't normally include them in resumes or bios, though there are times I do, when I feel they'll be relevant, such as when contributing to a bid on a project involving engineering (and therefore rich in engineers, who will think better of me for being one of them) even though I'll be doing software design. I don't normally include them on the ""About Me"" slide (if I even have one) in presentations I give, but I do for the course I teach at the local university, where having a doctorate is relevant. I never introduce myself as Dr Gregory, and only answer to it when it's ironic from friends, or at the aforementioned university. I don't include an email signature at all, but I do encourage my staff to mention PMP and related qualifications in their signatures. To me the key is relevance. It has to be on-topic to tell someone your qualification. If not (say you're writing to your fellow pre-school parents) it just looks like showing off."
438,"I think the wording of your resignation letter is important. After you've told them in person that you are leaving, and why, you might just write: This is to confirm our conversation of today that I am resigning effective Jan 12th. However, writing something a little longer makes a big difference. Last month a young chef I know resigned for a job in a larger restaurant, with opportunities that are not possible at the old job. The resignation letter was carefully written, and expressed gratitude for specific things and wished the restaurant success in the future. It also acknowledged that this was a family business and the leaving employee had a relationship with the whole family, and wished them all the best. Remember that if you write ""I have enjoyed working with you"" or ""I have enjoyed learning from you"" it doesn't mean that every single minute was a joy and a delight, just that there were times you enjoyed. Surely that's true? The owner was originally a little ticked on receiving the verbal notice, since he was losing one of his best workers, who he scheduled on the busy nights and relied on to carry a lot of the weight. But after the letter was delivered, he was delightful and friendly for the rest of the notice period! The young chef has visited and eaten a few times since and everything's been friendly. You can say whatever you want verbally, even ""I just couldn't work with D any more and I think it's best for all of us that I have found something else"" or ""I knew you would never give me the extra responsibilities I deserve"". But your letter will stick with them. In large companies it will be filed forever, of course, but even in small ones it has an impact. Write something nice. Make the reason for leaving all about yourself (I’m ready for some new challenges and am excited about the next steps I am taking) and thank them for something, however small, they have given you over the years. Wish them well."
439,"I would think it might make sense if there are shared workstations. Some offices might have these for contractors that are only on-site for a short period, or when departments are moving and some employees need to be seated there temporarily. I remember once being in an IBM building and they had common workstations all set up alike for the IBM contractors that spent 90% of their time at their client's site but would occasionally need a ""homebase"" in this facility, and for rarely more a few days. If 5S is followed on these shared workstations, anyone who uses one will be able to use them all without have to re-find the stapler, the phone, the sticky notes, etc... They will all have the same familiar feel no matter what floor it's on or what building it's in. If an office has private workstations, these rules should probably only apply if the primary user of them wants them to. Common areas, such as meeting rooms and kitchens, should try to follow these rules when applicable. For example: we have labels on the drawers in the kitchens on every floor, the layout and storage of common items (tea, coffee, sugar, etc...) is as consistent as possible (one or two kitchens are weirder owing to architectural features, such as a pillar in the middle), and every user of the kitchen is expected to help maintain the state of it. At our own personal desks, anything goes!"
440,What is the purpose of references?. In every place that I have ever worked for I had to provide references.  Most of the time I have provided people with them if I have worked with and have good relationships with. Now as far as I can tell in the US there is no responsibility placed on the reference giver.  If that is the case what is the purpose of references? As an example see the References section of this job application
441,"Employment law in most modern countries forbids discrimination based on religion. With that being said, all human beings discriminate on prejudices concious or sub-concious. Somebody I used to know was being called in for an interview in a department I was not part of.  I was working in a swing space in that area one day and overheard the interviewer mention his name about calling him in to schedule an interview.  Right as he picked up the phone I just mentioned casually that I used to work with him and that he was a nice guy.  He asked me what I thought about him, I said he was a brilliant guy, a little eccentric and that I first met him at a political rally. His eyes lit up and the only thing he asked me was, ""What rally was it?""  I told him that I would rather not say.  He then got indignant and said, ""Just tell me..."".  Reluctantly I told him, basically exposing his and my political affiliation.  He then looked at me in disgust and told me, ""Thank you that was helpful"" and then hung up the phone and started looking at the next resume. The bottom line is that you may be proud of your title, but it is just not a good idea.  By doing this you are breaking the cardinal rule of ""Never Discuss Religion or Politics at Work"".  You are exposing something about yourself that a hardcore Athiest may look upon and subconciously judge you. It is a bad idea, don't do it."
442,"One of the purposes of references it to verify the information you've given on your CV (resume) is factually correct. In the UK this is limited to an employer confirming that you did work for them between the dates you have specified. For a university/college it will be to verify that you gained the qualifications you have claimed you got. These are different from personal references where someone (hopefully) says you are a trustworthy person who'd they'd employ again given the chance (assuming they were your manager). General references are an additional check for the prospective employer to make to prove you are who you say you are without the potential expense of checking government documents. Obviously they can be forged, but if you're found out then you'd likely be immediately fired."
443,"Turns out that this is actually quite the complicated field and that there is also quite a bit of difference between how things are treated in the United States and the United Kingdom so this answer will focus on the United States usage. With regards to the order of post-nominal letters the standard order in the United States is as follows: Religious orders Theological degrees Academic degrees - Which should be listed in ascending order if there are multiple degree is different fields. Thus, someone with a PhD would not list all of their preceding degrees if they are all in the same field, but if they were to earn an MBA they would list it as [Name], MBA, PhD. Also, holders of a PhD should not introduce themselves as doctor as a matter of course, the only appropriate use is by holders of a MD in a professional setting. Honorary degrees, honors, decorations - Of which honorary doctoral degrees would be listed and which also do not confer any sort of courtesy title such as ""Doctor"". Professional licenses, certifications and affiliations - For which if there are multiple then they should be listed in alphabetic order. Retired uniformed service With regards to what should actually appear, it depends upon the environment involved and the actual context. Generally it is only appropriate to the academic degrees if it is directly relevant to the context which is why generally they only see heavy usage in academic environments or in the medical profession. Likewise, professional licenses and the like would only be listed if they are relevant to the environment (i.e.a CPA should not include it if they are working for a software company as a developer) and should be added or dropped from correspondence as needed. Thus, the usual rule of thumb in the United States it that less is better and in most cases they are dropped completely from anything less than very formal correspondence."
444,"There are 3 types of references: Job Reference: The purpose is to confirm that you actually worked at the company in the position that you are claiming when you claimed to work there.  People do fake their resumes and this can weed out some of the fakes. Professional Reference: The purpose of this is to find a peer or supervisor that you have worked with that will talk to the quality of your work, and your work ethic.  In a professional setting this is the reference that usually means the most. Personal Reference: This is someone who knows you that is willing to vouch for you.  The idea is that if someone is going to vouch for you they are willing to have you work with them.  Ideally this type of reference should be someone that the reviewer knows and respects.  We like to say ""it is what you know not who you know"" but the reality is most of the time that is false.  If you know the right person you have an edge, in many cases, over someone of similar or even slightly better skill set. The reason these are important is that your past performance is usually indicative of the type of performance that can be expected in the future.  So having good references is important.  The more recent the better."
445,"Other than confirming that a candidate isn't outright lying on their resume, I agree that references don't have a ton of informational value. I say this mainly because unless the candidate is brain dead they aren't going to give you a person's name unless that person will give them a glowing review. To me, as a hiring manager, the main value of references is: Can this person come up with three people (other than Mom) who will say nice things about them and their work?"
446,"What data supports the benefits of telecommuting/working from home?. There are a lot of discussions with regards to Telecommuting and Work from Home at various places I worked.  In most cases a company allowed people to work remotely but there are some that don't. My question is if I need to convince someone that this would be beneficial for the company is there any hard data, case studies or other evidence with respect to productivity, cost effectiveness, etc that could be used to convince management of the benefits of telecommuting?"
447,"Bosses expect that employees will quit sooner or later. So just the fact of quitting will not make them think less of you. What will make them think less of you is how you behave during your notice period and what things break after you were gone that are a result of something you did or did not do (or let them know about). I think one of the most critical things you can do is to not leave them with a mess to clean up. Think about what you would want available to you on the first day of a new job about your duties, where things are, etc. and create a transition document that lets your boss know everything critical that will need to be passed on to others. Let him know the state of all current projects - whether they are complete or how far from completion they are, where any files that will be need to complete the project are, any admin passwords you might have (that will remind him to reset them). I prepare this document and give it to my boss at the same time I give him my resignation letter typically and then we discuss, who to transition projects to and what I can get completed before I leave. If you commit to finishing something before you leave, then make sure to honor your commitment."
448,"I don't know of any specific studies to point you to, but there's tons of resources around the web that talk about this. There are also the occasional conferences hosted that talk about how to manage remote teams, which is what will be the most important for folks in management roles. Besides, the most likely way to get this implemented in your place of work is going to be a specific application of the supposed benefits to your workplace, and convincing your supervisors that they don't need to physically see you in order to know what you're up to, and to feel like they can have some idea of whether or not you're getting done what needs to get done. There are also situations where the type of work you do doesn't work well with remote team members. For example, I currently work at a place where most of my work is creative and/or requires long periods of concentration, and collaboration between team members doesn't need to happen every day. As a result, we have the option to work from home about two days out of the month - but really, two days out of the month is more than enough. Too much time away from your peers and you start to lose the huge benefit of collaboration at a moment's notice. I also previously worked at a very fast-paced, team-supported enterprise IT environment where teams of people would support customers together. It was unrealistic to have this structure, and have everyone work from home, because if something was going wrong in a customer's environment (e.g. a major outage) it was WAY more efficient to just look across your desk and say, ""Joe, the email server at [customer xyz] is down,"" because Joe might need to know that for the next 25 calls he's about to take, or even the call he might be currently on. Sure, we could have used some collaborative, online board where information like this is spread, but it's just not the most efficient method in that kind of situation. When critical communication absolutely has to happen within seconds, the challenges of remote teams become too much to be practical, in some settings. So, ultimately, I would suggest you look at the myriad information sources available on this topic, try to find a few that seem to describe a working environment most like the one in which you work, and try some of the things they suggest. Any successful deployment of a work remote strategy is going to have to be highly tailored to the company culture, the type of work, and several other things that are specific to you that a study just won't cover, other than anecdotally. I don't think a formal study is going to have the kind of impact you need to convince your supervisors to try it anyway (can you really see them taking the time to read a formal, scholarly study on the topic?) - I think you need to suggest it, and just take the leap."
449,"How do I maintain a good relationship with my old boss after being promoted?. I have been in some situations where I have been promoted above my current boss and ended up being his boss. What are some strategies I can use to make sure that I still have a good working relationship with him? He may resent me as a result of the promotion, but will probably not show it to me as I am now his superior."
450,"How can I encourage a culture of punctuality in a software company?. As a new technical lead in a new company, what are some additional strategies to employ to change the culture of the development team so that people show up at the time that I've requested? TLDR :  My team doesn't show up on time.  I've tried to compel them and it isn't working. Background Data: Small company, 30 employees, 5 members of my team. The previous lead is still on staff as a regular developer. The culture prior to my arrival was one of informality with no set boundaries or core hours.  This culture was not challenged by the corporate leaders.  Most people on the team would show up between 10:30 and 11:00 because of this. Other departments, due to the nature of their work, have set start times of either 8 or 9. This discrepancy and unpredictability causes a lot of angst between my department and other departments.  As such, I sat the team down and specified a 'no later than' time of 9:30.  I explained my reasoning and I explained the benefits of such a scheme and the negatives of the current scheme.  It was a long and contentious conversation and 3 of the 5 people on the team were quite displeased. Needless to say, people aren't showing up on time (and 9:35 is not on time.) I've scheduled our daily standup meeting at 9:30 as an added motivator.  Knowing that it takes a little bit of time to transition start times (with commute, etc...) I initially would wait to begin the meeting until everyone showed up, but now I just start the meeting (and often finish the meeting) with whomever is present.  That seems to not be making a difference either and it's making the team less cohesive. Conversations on an individual and group basis yield the same results as the original conversation (i.e. they don't see the value, think I'm taking away a perk of the job, etc...) I have the full support and backing of the senior management team and am empowered to employ whatever devices I feel appropriate to get this taken care of. My current next step is to send someone home and make them take the day off.  Is that too drastic?  Are there alternative strategies that I'm overlooking that could help me solve this problem? Edit based on questions in Jarrod's answer How new of a technical lead? 6 months, at this company,  at the time of this question. Why are you imposing purely non-technical managerial policies? It is in the scope of my position as defined by executive management. What are your management credentials? 10 years experience as a technical lead. No formal education or certification in anything managerial. What previous personnel management experience do you have? I have been a technical lead for 10 years.  I've been responsible for hiring/firing/interviewing/reviewing/leading/building a few different technical teams. Have you earned the respect of the team in a technical manner? Yes Have you earned the respect of the team in a managerial manner? I was interviewed for technical and managerial ability by the team.  I was clear and straightforward about how I like to run technical teams and how I like to run projects (with the obvious caveat that that is just a starting point and culture and personnel ultimately influence where I land.)  There are many things, from a managerial perspective, that the team is quite happy with. Did the previous technical lead step down? Yes. Was the previous technical lead demoted? No.  It was his request. Was the previous technical lead effective? For a time.  But, growth of the company and the codebase made his style ineffective. Does the majority of the existing team have a more personal relationship with the previous technical lead? Yes. Is the previous technical lead effectively still in charge? No. Then [the previous culture of informality with no set boundaries] must have been working? It worked for a time, when the company was still a startup.  It has grown and evolved well beyond the startup phase and, due to that growth, is not nearly as effective as it once was.  Especially as other departments have introduced a bit more formality and predictability. Was the team successful in delivering useful products when promised? At the beginning.  But, as the company and the product grew, quality and delivery times slipped significantly. Doesn't sound like you even considered or explored some kind of compromise with your team or the external teams based on their negative feed back. Did you? Of course I have, I'm not a rookie.  The fact of the matter is, I respect the fact that the rest of the company works in an inflexible box due to the nature of their responsibilities.  The team was unwilling to compromise on their flex time and, in many cases, the other departments are unable to compromise.  I have also addressed the negative feedback specifically with the other departments and implemented a number of things to make things better.  One of the big benefits of this change was to improve predictability and change perceptions. Final Update From the original crew of 5, 2 have been replaced.  The first was the previous team lead.  We could not see eye-to-eye on how to run development projects and he could not accept changes to what he had previously laid down, so we mutually agreed to part ways.  The second lost interest in the work, made a couple of big mistakes and we also mutually agreed to part ways. The team, as a whole, now shows up early enough to ensure plenty of coverage for the rest of the company.  What ultimately worked was mandate and peer pressure.  In addition, other changes that have been instituted have resulted in nearly all of the inter-departmental angst to be resolved.  Everyone still gets to work on awesome projects, mostly of their choosing, at their own pace at an exciting company and they are all quite content despite the job market being ridiculous in the area. I have been promoted to an executive position and the new 'problem team' has been moved under me (in addition to still retaining control of the dev team and still developing.)  I'm now working to help them perform better and be better teammates to their colleagues.  I don't have the punctuality issue with this new team... Their issues are accuracy and communication."
451,"The best advice is to follow Wheaton's Law and Don't be a dick :  Treat everyone you work with respectfully, ask as opposed to dictating, and accept meaningful input, including criticism, when it's offered.  This works well in the case where you're promoted over someone, or when you're brought in as an outside hire to take over an existing team. If you already have a good working relationship continue to interact with your boss as you always have.  In my experience the best supervisor/employee relationships work because they interact as a team rather than a superior/subordinate.  You each presumably have some valuable skills that the other doesn't possess, so continue to play off your strengths and you'll both come out looking like wonderful employees. If your working relationship was never really strong to begin with, or if you were constantly battling each other, then it depends more on personalities: If your boss-turned-subordinate is the resentful sort who will obstruct you it might eventually require a one-on-one chat about how things need to work (or a chat with the next level up in management if that doesn't work). If they're an agreeable sort of person who understands why you were promoted over them you can probably find a way to work together the way you would if you already had a strong working relationship. Above all remember that if your former boss has been there longer than you they've probably got a lot of valuable insider knowledge.  Just because they were passed over for promotion doesn't mean you shouldn't avail yourself of that by asking for their input and assistance: It helps you be more effective in your new role, and from a psychological standpoint it makes your new subordinate feel like their input is valued and respected - a Good Thing all around."
452,"There are still multiple avenues available to you for handling this issue one of which would be to change the role that the department plays such as for example: If you are working with software developers you could change the role for a certain or people during the week to have them do support for the other departments, which requires 1 or more to come in at 9 or earlier and if that doesn't work you could always invoke an insubordination clause which normally is present in any employment handbook in the US .  Personally I've always been against using this clause, which gives a manager an avenue to reprimand and even fire someone for cause but in your case this may be appropriate.  So review the employee handbook and discuss it with your superior if you have any that you will be doing this. The basic idea is as follows: You set the rule that at least 1-2 or all people should be at work by hour X. If your team members don't have a valid excuse not to show up or persist in this practice you as manager should reprimand them and possibly fire them. As a manager doing what I described would be the last resort but based on what you are describing you may have reached that point.  There are many articles on could constitute employee insubordination that you can find online and these are just a few examples: BlogSpot Duhaime Of course the unfortunate consequence may be high rate of turn over in your group which would poorly reflect on you as a manager but it will enforce the discipline and likely kill morale in the process. Now having said all of that I do have one question:  Do you really need your team to be in earlier then when they come in?"
453,"It's been my experience that knowledge workers don't like being dictated to about policies for which they see no purpose.  You do state a purpose, but the employees you are managing seem to think it is not a good one.  Further, there are probably alternatives that you have not considered, and given what sounds like an issue being ""dictated from above,"" your employees may either not have thought of them, do not feel comfortable proposing them, or feel that they would simply be shot down. If the only reason you are implementing the policy is because of tension with people in other departments, it's your job to manage that tension so that your people can work most effectively.  I don't think that's the only reason, though.  For example, what if a developer is needed to fix an urgent production issue that happens at 8:00 or 9:00 or whatever other time?  However, it is unlikely that you need all your developers present to fix that issue.  What if you had a rotating (unless someone volunteers) ""early"" schedule, so that each developer takes a turn being required to be there at 8:00 (or 9:00, etc.)?  That solution seems more likely to satisfy both the business needs and the desires of your employees.  Everyone ""shares the pain"" (or inflicts it on someone who doesn't mind it).  People can come in and work most of the time when they feel they would be most productive.  This is just one possibility, but it may generate discussion with your employees about how to solve the real problems and satisfy everyone's interests here. If you choose to go down the more disciplinary route, and the ""start time"" issue truly is important to your developers, you will lose your good ones to other employment.  Your employees are likely to feel insecure in their jobs (what if some real emergency actually happens one day to make someone late?).  Further, this can be seen as a shift in management in the wrong direction (from your employees' perspective), since they did previously have experience working under someone else. It's up to you, of course, but I would urge you to take a step back and try harder to see the situation from your employees' perspective.  You have a job to do, of course, but I think there are solutions that better satisfy everyone's interests than the one you are proposing."
454,"Does keeping one's desk extremely clean appear lazy?. I do all of my work on my PC and I like to keep my desk very clean; it helps me think. I'm pretty much the only one of this mindset at my company and most other's desks are covered with papers, notes, ect. I've gotten a few teasing comments that ""Hard workers have messy desks"", always said in a good natured, joking way, but I'm wondering if it really does appear unusual/lazy. These comments are always from coworkers, my boss has never said anything about it. I'm a programmer so I rarely print anything, and if I'm given paper I keep it organized and file it away. At most I usually have an inbox, my iPad/Phone, my desk phone and a legal on my desk. I'm also the youngest in the office; I've pretty much grown up in an age where information is digital, so I think that's part of the clash. Most of my coworkers print things to show them to me when I'd rather have a screenshot for my records. Is this clean appearance something to be concerned about or is it harmless? How can I tell?"
455,"How should I make up time when I'm late?. I'm salaried, and my employer's corporate culture is fairly lax about when we work as long as we cover our expected spans of time each day. I've occasionally had trouble getting to work, and I'm never sure if I should stay late or show up early on the next day(s) to make up for it. I'm a programmer/systems analyst, so at least some of my work can be done regardless of when I'm at work. Most of us leave before 5 o'clock.  My boss usually leaves before I do, so I don't think staying after gives the same appearance as showing up early, but either way I get my work done. My time's not directly monitored in any way. Should I show up early or stay late to make up for late appearances?"
456,"In my experience, it's 100% about the culture and nothing to do with an RFC on cleanliness. My workplace is the exact opposite. The CEO values cleanliness and tidiness, so necessarily my work area is as tidy as I can manage. I've actually gotten lectured on my lack of neatness. As always, communication is going to be key. A quick, private conversation with your superior can clarify how serious your coworkers are when you get teased. If the culture dictates that ""hard workers have messy desks,"" then either mess up your desk or fight the current the whole way. You should make it clear that your desk tidiness is essential to your productivity."
457,"Your coworkers are fools. Developers rarely have to print anything out, as you mention.  My desk happens to be cluttered, but it's with Dr. Pepper 10 cans and Dilbert calendar cartoons, mostly. In other words, most developers have little, if any work-related content scattering their desks.  That you choose to live a bit more cleanly and more organized than the rest of us, and also keep it free of crap is hardly cause for embarrassment."
458,"I think this falls into the assumptions/stereotypes category, and is highly based on the culture where you work. It's kind of hard to answer for everyone, because perceptions are highly personalized, though I have heard this sentiment many times, usually to justify a messy work environment, even though there was no correlation to the amount of entropy on one's desk and the amount of ""productivity"" coming from that desk. My personal perspective is this: my desk is usually messy, but I need to clear it occasionally just to clear my head, my workspace, and to feel like my space is as useful as it can be. I once had someone come up to me the day after I'd cleaned my desk, look over at the guy across from me who we all knew barely did enough to stay employed, and this person ( not very jokingly) implied that I didn't look very busy, and that I should learn from the guy across from me. This person didn't work in my department, wasn't ""over"" me in the organizational structure in any way, nor did they actually work with or rely on the other guy who barely did any work, so really they didn't know what they were talking about. That didn't stop me from taking it a little personally, but no, I've never see a consistent correlation between output/productivity and cleanliness, except when the disorganization reaches such a height that it becomes a burden to doing new work."
459,"I work in a similarly relaxed environment, where the basic rule is ""Put in the time and get the work done"".  Sometimes this means 35 hour weeks, sometimes 50 hour weeks, and if you're in late you're pretty much on your honor to stay late and make up time (or take the work home). If your work is getting done and meeting (or preferably exceeding) standards/expectations you're probably fine with whatever method you pick to get your time in.  If you think there might be a question though you should pull your boss aside and ask. At my last company I mentioned it during every performance review, something along the lines of ""I know we're doing the flex time thing, and I think it's great. If you would prefer I were here on a specific schedule just let me know."""
460,"I think if you talk to your supervisor, and the people around you, they are the best source of information on how they measure and/or value the clock. Totally depends on your company culture. In some places, when you're salary the concept of ""late"" has basically no meaning. So long as you show up for important meetings with co-workers and clients, you get things done, and you turn your work in when you say you will (because deadlines still definitely matter). Being in the office beyond this often has a very high networking and collaboration benefit to you, especially before and after ""official"" work hours, because that's when much of the networking happens, so I generally try to be around beyond just when most people are there at least a few days a week, but that's my personal approach. Back to your question, some people who are salary still carry the concept that ""work"" is done between certain hours of the day. However, your workplace can also be the other way around, where deliverables and measurables are the only thing that matters, and when you're physically in your seat makes absolutely no difference. When I transitioned from being hourly to salary within the same job, it was very hard for me at first to shake the ""I need to be here exactly between time X and time Y,"" because that's what I'd always known."
461,"The best motivating factor is trust. Team unity is of ultimate importance in accomplishing your goals.  Rule cultures are bred of distrust, and sticks and prods to enforce rules will only further erode trust from your team. Rather than being concerned over exact times and informal cultures, try figuring out what the intrinsic values are. Does 9:30 (or any arbitrary time) really matter? Or is it that your team needs to make sure they are not hindering the work of other teams by their absence? Does 5 minutes make a difference? Or is it most important that all members join in the daily standup? Is informality a problem? Or is flexibility a benefit? I would dig at the core of the issue, which is that your team hasn't bought into the idea.  See where the disconnect is, but avoid creating a rules culture .  Sending them home for being late (a disciplinary tactic you'd find in an elementary school) will lead your team to believe you see them as children who can't be trusted."
462,"It's one of those ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situations.  If you keep your desk clean, you'll get complaints; if you keep it cluttered, you might get complaints as well. Your work and how you work speak louder that what your desk looks like, so let those aspects shine through.  These teasing comments are most probably nothing but good-nature ribbing (like you mentioned), and is probably an effort to mark you with a quirk.  Maybe next they'll call you a nickname.
If you're that concerned about it, you can ask your superior about it. In any case, you can try to throw people off by putting a fake stack of papers in your inbox and emptying it by the end of the day. :)"
463,"Personally I've always heard that it is better to keep your desk clean as ""a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind"" and reflects negatively upon the employee as well. Periodically you will find articles about the clean versus cluttered desk debate and honestly it does come down in part how you work, what you are working with, and the company culture. In practice the best workers tend to be the ones that know where to find things as soon as you ask for it so you are best off taking that to heart and keeping your desk as you like it, as long as you can find everything you need when you need it."
465,"How can I encourage our team to have shorter stand-up meetings?. We have status meetings every day, consisting of 8 - 10 people. These are scheduled to last 20 minutes and be stand-up meetings . Frequently they last 30 or even 40 minutes and the discussion goes all over the place. Typically more than half the people (including the meeting leader) sit during the meeting. I have spoken with the meeting leader (also the team leader) because my contribution lasts about two minutes (if there are questions) which means I have 18 - 38 minutes wasted time. I've tried: speaking to him directly, saying that this is too long just leaving the meeting (didn't go down well) What else can I do? Or should I just resign myself to losing this part of my life every day?!"
466,"Meetings is one of the necessary evils of working in a team. Our status meetings usually lasts for 60mins, although my status reports only lasts for about 10mins. For the remainder of the meeting, I usually try to contribute and take notes that may affect my work. From what you have said, I think that the following may work for you. If the remainder of the meeting are truly independent to your work, you could explain to your meeting leader that your time would be more productive spending it at another task. If the meeting stops being a status meeting and becomes a discussion meeting, you could bring your laptop and do work at the meeting. Be an active participant of meeting by asking questions and commenting on other members' status. This is hard to do without looking like the a pseudo leader, and risk stepping on other people's toes."
467,"I would start by just asking an open question, ""Hey guys, I just wanted to ask about the format of these meetings. I think it's important to share status, touch base, and make sure we're all pulling in the same direction, but it seems like we go over time a lot. Would anyone mind if I propose some ideas on how to keep the meetings short and on schedule?"" Notice that I'm suggesting an approach that doesn't attempt to put anyone on the defensive, blame any one person or sub-group for the state of things currently, and instead focuses on trying to find out if there is agreement, with a promise to bring ideas to the group on how to change it. Then see what happens. Take the feedback carefully, but openly. Start suggesting changes, maybe even this: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/02/meetings-where-work-goes-to-die.html This doesn't always work. A close friend of mine was inundated with a weekly meeting where the participants used the meeting as a reason to socialize with each other. When that friend tried to change things up, they took the approach of trying to crack the whip, keep people on the agenda, and forcing people to move along. They met with a lot of resistance, and got kind of a ""bad cop"" reputation. This eventually worked, but took longer than appealing to a shared sense of concern about the meeting themselves. It also worked probably because said friend had some clout, and could get away with telling people to simply get back to work. If you're not in that position, you'll likely need to be a little more grassroots about it, or find someone with some clout to come over to your side and fight with you."
468,"How can a company implement a ""20% time"" program like Google's?. I've read that Google's 20% rule is about encouraging fun and innovation. How can my company implemented and manage a program like this? A good answer to this question should also cover these sub questions: What are the boundaries for that 20% of time? What happens if I have to work 40hours to complete my project on time? Would I then expected to put in an additional 10 hours of ""Fun"" work? Can I just spend 16 regular hours the next week? If I miss a week do I just lose the 20% hours?"
469,"Left this as a comment, but I'm dead serious: take away their chairs . Stand-up meetings are stand-up because it makes it uncomfortable for everyone to stay too long. If people are sitting that's not fair to those standing and it's encouraging them to hang around. This is especially a problem if the meeting leader is doing it. He's setting the example, and he needs to get it short. If at all possible have the chairs removed from your meeting room before the meetings or move them out of the way, away from the table and don't let people sit . If possible, just remove the chairs from a meeting room for a week and watch the meeting time fall. If you can't physically remove the chairs for practical reasons, get the meeting leader to be very clear that it's a standing meeting in literal terms, make people stand up. After people are used to standing you can stop removing the chairs, but you need to do something to drop the time, and making them stand proves you're serious about this, and it really does provide incentive to keep it short. As Andrew notes, make sure you respect accessibility and disability concerns; if some of your team needs a chair because they can't reasonably stand up for a meeting's length, of course you should provide them a chair. Consider sending out an email stating that next weeks meetings will be standing meetings but if anyone needs to sit they should reply back so you can accommodate them."
470,"Keeping a meeting short is a skill, and it's a lot harder than it looks.  It also requires the support of the meeting leader, but it sounds as if he wants to help but doesn't know how.  Some ideas: Clearly define what is on and off topic.  For example, our daily standups answer 3 and only 3 questions:  what did you do yesterday, what are you doing today, and what's getting in your way? Clearly define a time limit.  I've heard of teams bringing in a game timer.  After one minute, the discussion gets tabled. Clearly define an acceptable outlet for off topic discussion.  Teams occasionally need more than 15 minutes to talk about things.  When you notice that happening, schedule another meeting with that topic as the primary agenda item.  It's amazing how well this works, because people aren't desperate to get heard while they have the floor.  I know some teams who regularly schedule such a meeting immediately following their standup.  People who don't care are free to leave at that point.  Our team does pretty well with about one extra design meeting per week, lasting about an hour."
471,"How do your busiest people transfer their knowledge?. We have recently polled our company wide wiki users and found out that there are two large groups of users: people with lots of knowledge but (who claim they have) no time to document people with time but (who claim they have) not enough knowledge worth documenting Each group covered almost 50% of the users! How do your companies handle this? That is, how do you encourage your busiest / most knowledgeable people to share their knowledge?"
472,There is an unfortunate trend in my experience when it comes to knowledge transfer and that is the lack of interest on the receiving end .  You could have the person willing to do the brain dump to someone else but if there is no interest in its receipt why would the expert take the time? When I was leaving several places where I worked I was asked to do this because I was one of the very few people who understood the systems I was supporting but when someone was assigned to me for this task I could see in their demeanor that this was bothersome to them and they had no interest in it.  So my motivation to do the knowledge transfer was basically reduced to nothing. So the only thing that I could suggest on the subject is make sure the person receiving knowledge is actually interested in the subject.  Captive audience that asks questions does wonders for motivation of the speaker.
473,"I suggest recording screencasts of about 45 mins.  Get everyone together and the presenter does a screencast and transfers the knowledge.  It's easier and more effective to show how to do something, then just written documentation (which might also include extra time for formatting, etc.) At one place I used to work, they had a ""Lunch n'learn"" on a weekly or monthly basis. One guy eats lunch early, and does a presentation for the team while they eat.  This might work if people are strapped for time."
474,"You can point out to the knowledge holders that they are likely spending a lot of time getting pestered by questions anyway.  Writing a wiki entry is a short term investment that pays off in the long run.  If they aren't getting pestered by questions, it's probably not important enough to document. Also, the knowledge receivers are a better choice to write a wiki article than you might think, because they understand the point of view of someone who needs to learn the topic.  It also helps organize and solidify their thoughts.  Having someone with more time write the article and run it by the guru for review could be very beneficial."
476,"How can I get people with difficult personalities to conform to expectations?. Following on from discussions related to Jacob G's question How can I encourage a culture of punctuality in a software company? and some related discussion in the site chat , I'd like to ask a closely related question: I've worked with some superstar technical talent in my career, and a small minority of them have been ""Prima Donna Programmers"" - believing that they are better than the rest of the company, not understanding or caring that their work habits are affecting other teams, etc. How can workers like this be made to understand the ""big picture"" and better integrated with the rest of the company? Are there any time/resource management or motivational techniques that can be applied, or are we left with the hard choice between ""Deal with them the way they are"" and ""Dictate new terms, then fire them if they don't comply""?"
477,"My suggestion is to budget documentation time into every project and make it part and parcel of what you do. If you haven't been doing that all along you probably need to schedlue ""Documentation Days"" to jumpstart things (for example, say every Friday after lunch those with the knowledge are freed from all other projects and just work on writing documentation). It can be hard to get the documentation culture into a company when it's never been part of the way things were done before, but the rewards are evident when you can hire a new person and have them up to speed and working independently within a week -- For example, the PostgreSQL project has a strong culture of maintaining excellent documentation. Their manual is better than some commercial products."
478,"This is one of those dangerous personality types;  dangerous, because they aren't likely to change .  When hiring (or being hired yourself), stay away. The reality is people aren't likely to change anything.  People learn, but they don't change their personality.  If a person is not open to learning by nature, there isn't much you can do. But is the choice really, ""deal with them the way they are"" or ""dictate new terms/fire them if they don't comply""?  Maybe, but the second isn't really an option at all — successful teams are built on trust and rules/ultimatums don't get you very far with trust.  I would go for a third option, if you have the power to make this happen: Make it clear that what makes an individual successful is making the team successful. Prima donnas have no place in such an environment.  A person gets to be a prima donna by being rewarded (in some way) for being the smartest person. * Make sure that doesn't happen and that everyone else is aligned in making the team succeed, and the prima donna will either need to follow or they will stand out for not helping accomplish (or even impeding) the team's goals. Likewise, the team's goal is to make the company successful.  If not, the team itself is a prima donna.  If lack of alignment around company mission/vision (or lack of company vision altogether) is a problem for you, I recommend the Entreleadership podcast series , particularly episode 2 (interview with Tony Hsieh of Zappos), 10 (team unity with Tony Dungy ) and the Jim Collins episodes.  I'd copy down some of the advice but the topic is too big and I could not do the interviews themselves justice. * Some people are rewarded by their own personal feeling of superiority when they put others down.  These people are the most unlikely to change.  They will probably need to go."
479,"The way I look at it there are two kinds of prima donnas, those who genuinely are superstars and those who are developers with an inflated idea of their own value and an attitude problem. Let's start with the second case as that is the easiest to deal with. Fire them and replace them with someone who will have a decent attitude. If they aren't providing anything special, your whole team is better off without them. They are like a cancer at the heart of your organization. The guy who is genuinely a superstar is harder. If you really, really need his skills, you may have to accomodate his arrogance. Then the trick is to make the others see why they don't get the same anount of flex. There is always resentment if one person seems to get better treatment than others. You really need to make the rest of team understand. If you don't really really need those superstar skills, then you and he may be happier if he moves on. You may still need to talk to him and let him know he is causing a problem with the rest of the company and that he needs to work with you some to fix it."
480,"One of our tech leads has a great policy, the third time she gets the same question, she writes up the answer and emails it to the person asking and to the knowlege wiki we have set up. Since she was probably going to write that email anyway, the only additional work is to add the address for the Wiki."
481,"What benefits are there of being allowed to take your kids to work?. I've always found the practice and, to some extent even the encouragement of this practice, puzzling. As far as I can tell there is no benefit for any of the parties concerned that is employers, employees, and especially kids in doing this. Could anyone enlighten me as to the benefits of this practice to the participants? Most offices are generally ill-equipped to handle the 5-6 year olds."
482,"This is really a policy problem, not a motivation one. Employees with critical knowledge should be given the opportunity and to document it and it should be mandatory. If they do not provide ample documentation and their supervisors have given them enough ""free"" time to do it, they should be disciplined. No matter how much a person knows or can accomplish, if they are the only one with that knowledge, then they are a liability. Documentation shouldn't be optional."
483,"Is it appropriate to request a delayed start date at a new employer to help find/train your replacement?. I plan on leaving my current position in the next year or so. I really enjoy my work, but I'm not challenged much any more, so it's time to move on. When I leave, I'd, ideally, like to help find and train my replacement. This process could take anywhere between one and three months depending on the quality of the candidates. This seems like an awfully long time to ask for between receiving a job offer and actually starting. Is it too long to ask for? Is it appropriate for me to even request this? Is there any danger that my new employer can rescind their offer to me in that time? Edit: everyone seems to be focusing on the three month figure, which is probably an extreme case. More likely it will be 1 - 2 months. It seems like asking for one month is at the high end of acceptable and anything more is not."
485,"From a manager's point of view (the manager you're departing from), it's hard to find good replacements, and you always wish you could keep your best people longer, but so long as I have appropriate notice, then the team around you should be able to prepare to take up the slack. Sure, it's going to take weeks, maybe months to train a replacement, but that's not your concern. I'm sure it would be appreciated by your previous employer if you stayed longer (if they like you, I'm sure they'd prefer you actually didn't leave at all), but so long as you're professional, courteous, and give sufficient notice (I think up to four weeks is generous, unless your a high-level execute, in which case longer departures might be more normal), your previous company should be fine with it. Changes in employees are a normal part of the process. I'm not saying that everyone is infinitely replaceable, but no company can survive if it's not able to change its staff. If you really want to help them, you can possibly offer to make yourself available via email (outside your new employer's business hours, of course), but that's really going over and above, and not at all usual or customary. Not only that, it's actually just kind of weird, and I would recommend against it. Whatever happens, figure out an official start date for the new place, and stick to it. If circumstances at your previous employer change at the last minute, and they really want you to stay an extra couple of weeks, well, that's really the previous employer's issue, I'm afraid. You've made a commitment to the new place, and you absolutely need to keep it . It's important. Finally, to put it one last way, you're leaving one relationship, and going on to another. Clean, courteous breaks tend to be the best. You wouldn't make yourself available for an unknown amount of time to a previous boyfriend/girlfriend, would you? If the person you were leaving wanted you to ""stay available"" (my words) for a few weeks afterward, wouldn't you think that wasn't exactly healthy, and that they should deal with the reality at hand, instead of trying to hold on to you?"
486,"It's going to be situational.  I would discuss it with the new company up front — before you receive a job offer.  Some companies will be fine with it, some will need you to start sooner. They might, however, wonder why.  If you are choosing to leave, why do you need to do this? Why would you prioritize your old company over the new one? That might give them pause. Lastly, here is some advice that is purely my opinion: it might benefit you to be more decisive in your moves.  If you think it's time to move on, do it now.  If you find a place to move on to, don't hesitate.  You can begin to prepare documentation for training as a courtesy to your current employer, but you're not really under an obligation to do so."
487,"I always try to set up a wiki in order to document things. Wikis are simple and encourage adding bits and pieces as time goes by. With formal documentation systems, the blank paper seems overwhelming to the users and as a result only gets filled out when you put a gun to their head. I usually walk around with a notebook, and I'd enter things in the wiki so that they can be located easily - this way, annual tasks can be repeated correctly rather than having to rediscover how they were supposed to happen. One previous boss was only willing to permit ""full and complete documents"" which were never done. He banned wikis because he believed that they encouraged lax thinking and poor documentation. Since the previous ""full and complete documents"" were all 5+ years old at the time I left, he did not care to comprehend that his desires were in direct opposition to how his staff worked. Only in the direst emergency when one critical person left, he made and recorded webcasts of walking through the code that only he understood. This was one of the few times that when an employee gave notice, that he transferred knowledge, instead of working on stuff until the day he left."
488,"That's an interesting one. I'm guessing you're not referring to the ""Bring your kids to work for a day"" practice, but more regular visits from the kids? Maybe a situation where a kid comes to the parent's place of work at the end of the work day because school is out, but they're too young to go home and be by themselves? The only case I can think of where this would be beneficial is if it's a family business, and the kids coming to work weren't just hanging out, but were actually learning the business, and were doing something useful rather than simply being a distraction to the parents. Of course, at ages 5 and 6, I think it's really hard to justify it, even then. I think early teenager age (12-16 maybe) would be more normal for that sort of thing. In the ""I don't want my kid to be a latchkey kid ,"" case it may be a situation where the parents can't provide day care, or other appropriate care for young kids due to economic or other pressures, and they've made special arrangements with the employer. Of course, that's a bit of a different situation, and probably beyond the scope of your question."
490,"Take your child to work day. In the US there is a practice originally called ""Take your Daughter to work day"". It has recently been renamed ""Take your child to work day"". The original idea  was to show daughters that there was a world of work beyond secretaries, nurses, and teachers. By inviting sons to work it has changed the dynamic. Is there still a benefit for any of the parties concerned -- that is employers, employees, and especially kids -- in doing this? Could anyone enlighten me as to the benefits of doing this to all the parties concerned? This is not related to the general question: What benefits are there of being allowed to take your kids to work? ."
492,"Forget the Word.  Do linkedIn and SO. I stopped doing traditional paper ""resumes"" (especially the Word ones) about 10 years ago.  Until 2 years ago I just did my own own simple web site resume.  Now I do linkedIn. If nothing else it sure cuts down on scammy head-hunters:- they want to upload you into their system.  If an actual job is there that you are a perfect fit for, a Word resume won't get in the way (i.e. be needed) in today's market. A side tip that does help though:- make sure emails about your information have a title of say ""Resume - Joe Smith, 617 555 1212 joe@example.com"". Nothing makes it easier to find and sort folks than clear labeling like that. This is the most true if you are in IT, but it's spreading rapidly in other industries."
493,"I used to visit my dad's office once in a while on the weekend with him when he had to do some extra work on a deadline. It was the first time I ever touched a computer (IBM OS/2) and I don't think I would ever have been as technically inclined as I am today if he hadn't taken me with him. All I did was play a couple of games/use a calculator on there, but I was totally enamored. Definitely changed my life, so I would urge you to consider that even though your kids don't seem to get much out of the time they spend at work with you, they might just not know it yet."
494,"Are digitally signed documents legally binding?. In this day and age, many documents are being passed around in email that require signing.  I myself send many contracts to clients as well as approval letters and such to the same clients.  I most of the time send the client a contract or approval letter with my acrobat pro digital signature and lock the document before sending the pdf to them.  Im just wondering if these documents that are digitally signed, and sometimes sent back to me digitally signed by my clients, legally binding?  Would these documents hold up in court or should I always ask for a hand signed copy be sent back to me. If the answer here is to send a hand signed copy back to me,  would a scanned copy that is emailed or faxed to me good enough or should I push for the client to send me a hard copy via mail?"
495,"Have dependable hours.  Often just having a set pattern is really helpful for the employer. Communicate that you value time.  Both your and theirs.  Stay late and it will stand out from your usual schedule (See 1 above), and make sure you mention ""oh I'm making up for soem for x'.  Or work at home and make sure you email or do whatever to show that you were active.  Over time it will be noticed but it has to be consistent. Talk to your manager.  Ask them what the right thing to do is.  Explain your situation.  Make reasonable requests if necessary and then go wit what your agree on and be true to your word and expect them to do the same."
496,"It sounds like you have tried honesty and bluntness so you are going to have to try work-arounds, but primarily accept it and try to make the best of it . Some things to try: Identify your heavy talkers and those who agree with you that the meetings last too long.  Apply what social pressure you can to the heavy-talkers to get them to cut it down.  This is best done tactfully. Since the meetings have a scheduled time try to schedule other meetings to start right after the scheduled end-time.  Before the meeting starts you can let the meeting leader know that if the meeting goes over you may need to slip out so you don't miss your other meeting. Employ a co-worker you trust in a different area to drop by or call the phone in that office with a question if the meeting goes too long.  You will have to return the favor.  (I've set up this system in the past to deal with awkward co-workers that don't know how to end a conversation, should work in this situation as well)  Just don't over do it or it will be obvious. If you have any processes or hardware that you manage, schedule them so that they send status updates to your phone 5 minutes after the meeting should end.  The audible reminder that it's past time may help to break things up. Mostly, I suggest that you work on a to-do list or sketch out plans and ideas - pen and paper. I would guess a laptop is going to get the same reception as walking out early."
497,"So long as the jurisdiction in which they are signed accepts digital signatures, and the signature was produced using an accepted secure method, then maybe - consult a lawyer. Although, this standard may not even be required, if the signature in question is not contested. Just think of all the legal documents all of us have signed, and then faxed to some destination - the receiving end has only a printed copy of a digital representation of that document, and those can be successfully defended legally. Some people wonder about this because of the supposed ease with which a digital image of a signature can be replicated (it would seem that forging a digital signature would be as easy as copying an image from the internet - it's just a file, right?), but the law is able to handle these situations, the technology has built into it ways to detect if signatures are copied and/or manipulated, and the reality is that very few signatures are ever contested anyway, and so in most cases the technology behind how the signature was created never comes into question. Many banks, for example (I used to work in the banking industry) have digital signature devices where you write on a screen instead of with an actual pen, and these are completely valid. Federal law (in the United States at least) also allows a digital copy of a paper check to be considered equally valid vs. the paper equivalent, due to sufficient mechanisms that allow for the origin and validity of said image to be verified, should it be contested (again, very few of them, vs. the total number of checks processed, are ever contested anyway so this is often a non-issue). Finally, digital signatures that are not representations of written signatures, but instead simply a typed name, combined with some secret only the actual signee would know (a PIN for example - I digitally sign my Federal tax return this way every year) serve to prove the authenticity of a digital signature. There are also many technologies within the cryptography community that are focused on digital signatures, and which come with methods for detecting forgery and manipulation. If perhaps you're wondering whether a physical signature is more difficult to forge than a digital one (and I realize that I'm probably going way past the original scope of your question at this point), that's simply not the case."
498,"Aaah, I see myself here. I would admit that in my own observation, I had been a culprit for many meetings which are disgraced and prolonged and while people won't speak-up, I realized that something needs to change. This year on - we would start off the meeting just some time before lunch, and I promised to them, that if meeting extended and stretched beyond lunch, I would pay for it! Fortunately after that bet, I guess I have been watching the clock and indeed didn't end-up paying for lunch :) What did I really do? I learnt several limitations that were primary distractors. Have a very clear and most hopefully only 1 agenda. Quite often, all team members work on many things simultaneously so we tend to do many meetings same time. That's where it clears up. Invite only those people who need to contribute (not those might be well off knowing). In old days there was euphemism that all team members needs to know everything that helps them get big pictures. In fact, that remained stuck because management used to praise that fact. However, when people are least concerned about a particular project - they add maximum points (out of their curiosity) and hence maximum delays. Visualize the format. I was a great hater of formatted reports and in a startup many things started and ended at the white board. However, I realized that because everything revolves around the white board, it kind of puts an unnoticed habit of not getting prepared . People will start discussing and even collect and format information while they are in meeting - clearly stretching style. We are still informal in the way of reporting, but now individual must prepare their data in XL sheets or charts or in the system prior to the meeting. Prepare (at least) yourself. I often used to enter meeting without really having content first hand. The result was, a big part of the beginning would get wasted on me and others only learning things first before it gets to a point where we discuss opinions and making decisions. Be assertive against gossip. When people get to gather, gossip, jokes and so on. People are sometimes just curious and end-up digressing the whole lot. We must ascertain that any talk against the agenda of meeting should be stopped. I have learned the most of this the hard way."

Generally, courts have treated the situation as ""if both parties treat it as a signature, then so will we"" (section 1-303 of the UCC calls this "" course of performance, course of dealing and usage of trade ""). I used to work for a company where we dealt with the signatures and attestations; ESIGN is a bit complicated as the supporting regulations also require things like the electronic documents be readable and provable for at least 10 years. PDF/A is an attempt to make PDF documents suitable for long-term archival."

505,"If that's what's needed by your old job to get your replacement up to speed it's absolutely alright, provided you discuss it with your new employer first and it won't sink your chance of landing the new job. For me it's a matter of professionalism: Up until my last day with my old employer I am still working for them.  It's my obligation to consider the best interests of that company, and if that means asking for a delayed start date at my new job (and doing so is acceptable to my new employer, to whom I now owe similar loyalty) then that's what I'll do. Of course this can be tempered by company loyalty: If your current job is treating you poorly and you don't value the references/long-term relationship with the company 2 weeks (or whatever the standard is where you are) is all they get and they can sort it out themselves :-)"
506,"It really depends on the environment: I work in IT. My jobs either require quiet, uninterrupted concentration/discussion/brain-work, or spending extended periods of time in datacenters with sensitive/expensive equipment, exposed cabling, open floor tiles, dangerous noise levels, and fire suppression systems which can be deadly to small kids (and none-to-healthy for large kids / adults!). I have no kids, but if I did I would not bring them to either of those environments: It's probably no fun for the kid in either situation, and being in the datacenter would be downright dangerous! Someone else might work in a more kid-friendly environment (curator at a petting zoo, tour guide at a children's museum, etc.), and maybe that wouldn't be a problem."
507,"When I was a kid, I remember going to the dealership where my Dad worked. He's a mechanic. I mainly remember sitting inside the car and pretending like I was driving it. I had to be maybe 4 or 5. I was one of those kids that would just go find something quiet to do. Not all children are like that though, as every situation is unique. Of course, there are countless dangers in a situation such as this to consider. I don't remember this, but I burnt my hands grabbing a hot tailpipe. Come to think of it, I think all of my siblings have learned that very hard lesson too :) These circumstances weren't the norm. They were generally weekends or times when it wasn't normal business hours, and the lot was a laid back small business, not a corporate giant. For situations where kids come to work everyday in an office environment, you'd definitely need a nursery or dedicated staff on hand to watch over the children, as the benefits gained by the parents being near the children would be completely lost if one had to stop what they're doing to go deal with whatever trouble they're getting themselves into. In an office environment, as long as there is dedicated space for the children and they aren't allowed to disrupt the normal workflow, this could be a great practice. Parents can: Check in on their kids during breaks Eat lunch with them Play with them Work and focus on getting the job done, while still being close to their kids. Child and parent will be more connected in this situation than children who are left in a remote daycare facility. If the children are allowed to run free, make noise, and be disruptive, then that would be incredibly bad for productivity of both the parents as well as other staff."
508,"I think it does help the kid. They learn quite a bit about the workplace, even though they don't realize it. To a kid, a workplace is an alien land that eats up one or more parents from 9 to 5. It really helps if they go there and like the place--it can remove a bit of their anxiety (personal experience). If they don't like the place--well you didn't try hard enough. Regarding the facilities: Make sure you bring whatever's required. Juice, food(lots of it), etc. Oh, and show them the bathroom first. Letting a kid play games is OK, but make sure you show them around the place and introduce them to (friendly) people first. Eat with them Give them something small to do--tearing confidential documents(the ones that you want to dispose of) is an idea. My dad let me do this at home many times--it was fun and appealed to my destructive tendencies. Don't just leave them in front of a computer, periodically check on them. Even better, keep them with you whenever possible. As I got older, I would sometimes help out at my dad's office--filing stuff and all. And get paid :D. For teenagers, it's a really nice thing to do since they can learn a lot about interacting with people."
509,"Creating a culture of punctuality may take time and may be something you have to compromise on somewhat. Since you're dealing with intelligent knowledge workers, you'll be more successful if you can get them to buy into the plan. Instead of focusing on the time, focus on the problem created by the scheduling issues. Present the problem as a challenge to the team and see what they come up with. The answer may be set schedules or it may be something different that solves the problem. It may be Monday, Wednesday, Friday are the 9am-sharp days while Tuesday and Thursday are the flex days. While the plan may not be perfect nor will it be exactly what you envisioned, finding a middle ground somewhere that will make both the development team happy, as well as solve the actual problem will prevent your staff from becoming bitter and seeing you as the enemy. Keep in mind that you're not dealing with a manufacturing process where everyone must show up at exactly 9:30am, when the whistle blows, so they can begin the mind-numbing task of assembling the same little plastic widgets repeatedly, until the whistle blows again, and the mind-numbed staff make their way out to the local bar for happy hour. My team doesn't show up on time. I've tried to compel them and it isn't working. Forcing smart people never works. You need to remember that you're dealing with highly educated, smart, creative people who are good at solving complex, abstract, and unique problems. These people, at least the really good ones, will never just blindly follow orders. This goes back to putting the problem in their hands, at least at first. If they do nothing, then you'll want to step in with your own solution. You mentioned that you're a new team lead. Stepping into a new position like this is challenging and stressful as you're not sure how to gain respect of the team and also be a good leader. This comes with experience, and it's common for inexperienced new team leads to attempt to ""compel"" or force people to do things their way. This is not leadership. Developers, and other knowledge workers, don't need a manager; instead, they need a leader. Great leaders inspire others to do great things, and this is your opportunity to lead your team to greatness rather than dictate it into despair. Research shows that people are more likely to commit when they have participated in determining what the solution will be rather than have that solution told to them, and this is especially true with knowledge workers. For inspiration, please see Seth Godin's Interview on the Difference Between Leadership and Management .  I highly recommend that anyone and everyone in a leadership capacity watch this short interview."
511,"On the contrary, I believe having a clean, neat, clutter free desk is a sign of greatness. There are several people that I work with who are minimalists, and they keep no more than a laptop and a plant on their desk, along with a cup for coffee or tea. Our corporate culture also doesn't focus on implying people are lazy or not working hard, something I've always concluded was just a way for people to steal the energy of others and bring them down. The military was like that, and I've always taken offense in someone telling me, even in jest, that I wasn't working hard enough. I'm surprised to hear several people here say that their coworkers say things like this to them. But, I digress, the people in our office with the clean desks have compared it to a form of zen. By creating an environment void of clutter, it opens up the mind to focus on creativity, thoughtfulness and freedom, which is why most of these people are either writers or designers. I am a bit envious of this minimalism, yet I've not been able to achieve it. My desk is cluttered, and I have a box tucked away under my desk that I just haven't been able to work up the nerve to throw away. Having a clean desk is a sign of discipline, focus, peace, creativity, greatness, and balance. Having a messy desk doesn't imply laziness, but it seems to me that having less is so much more difficult in a world where we all must have more. The Search for Simplicity , is an excellent blog article that gives another perspective on this topic."
512,"Have you considered the possibility that the prima donna workers may in fact be the way they are because it is their drive and personality that made them that way. Extremely successful people don't get where they are by being average, mediocre, falling in with the crowd, and just blindly doing what others want them to do. Take Steve Jobs for example. If you worked with him, you probably would have felt that he was a prima donna. Everything had to be his way and everything had to be perfect. In one example, he actually told the engineers of one of the first Mac computers that the circuit boards inside the machine weren't beautiful enough. In the end, he made a lasting, positive impact on the world, and we might attribute this to his eccentricity, stubbornness, and persistence. Creative people, entrepreneurs, developers, designers, writers, painters, musicians, chefs, and many other people who do creative work, tend to be more eccentric. The greater the contributions, the more eccentric the person may be. We even had a moderator on the Mathematics site who, according to meta posters, was a genius. Yet he couldn't get along and follow simple rules of the site. While this was an extreme case, it highlights the fact that some of the most gifted and talented people in our society will sometimes do things that others may not agree with. Therefore, you can weed out all of these gems out of your organization and replace them with a manufactured series of mediocre automatons who will blindly follow orders, or you can embrace the people who set high expectations for themselves and who bestow greatness upon the world. These same people will also expect a lot in return and make no allowances for anything they don't believe in. These people wouldn't have achieved the things they've achieved if they just blindly followed the flock or given into the whims of what others considered to be ""the rules."" This Apple Commercial from the Think Different Campaign may inspire you to rethink how you deal with these so-called prima donnas. If you look carefully enough, you may discover that these people are a lot more than what you see on the surface."
513,"We all work in our own way. We also tend to pick up on anything about people around us which is different. For myself, I go through cycles. My desk gets messier and messier as time goes on, right up to the point where there are too many things on my desk to easily find the immediate reference material I need. At this point I have a tidy up and file everything properly. I then have a clear desk for a few days until I start needing that reference material again, at which point it starts being pulled out of my files to populate my desk once more. So, depending of when it is in the cycle, I could look like I'm exceptionally tidy, tremendously messy or anything in-between. With regard to your co-workers perceptions of your tidiness, you are almost certainly taking this more seriously than they are. If it bothers you, you could always talk to them about it. It could be that their humour stems from the fact that they are jealous of how you manage to work in a paperless way, and would actually be interested to learn how you manage it. Finally, on the matter of printing things out. Many of us find reading documentation on screen hard on the eyes and e-paper e-readers simply aren't fast enough to update to be able to quickly flick through documentation. For many of us, dead-tree technology is far superior for some activities."
514,"Regardless of why you're doing it, to your team members it feels like you're taking away a perk. To some of them it may even be one of the major reasons why they're working for your company rather than another one. Essentially, you're asking them to take a reduction in their total compensation package. It's possible to convince them to take it, but you'll need good arguments and there almost certainly will be lingering resentment about it. You may or may not lose good people over this. From your description the main reason appears to be jealousy from other departments. Have you considered giving the other departments the same perk? In short: Don't do it unless you think it's worth losing some of them over it."
515,"In the United States you can leave whenever you want, however it is considered customary and polite for a normal worker to give 2-4 weeks notice before leaving.  For executives or top level management the acceptable notice is 4-8 weeks. Typically if I hate the job and the people working there with a passion then I usually give 2 weeks.  I give 4 weeks notice if I am involved in some critical tasks or projects or if I really care for the people I am leaving behind. Giving more than 4 weeks as a non-executive I feel starts to be rude to the new employer even if they tell you they are okay with it.  As somebody who hires though I would be willing to wait 4 weeks for good talent because it tells me they care enough about leaving their house in order before leaving and that is usually a very good sign."
516,"Maybe I have had people contact me looking to fill positions... actually I get several calls a month. Before I give them any information on me I want to know the following: How did you find out about me? This tells me alot.  If they found out through a someone I have contracted from someone I have performed work for I will give them more time than if they are a recruiter for a Contracting company that got me out of their database they get less.  If they are not willing to give me a solid answer I ask them to call back later.(they rarely do, then i just repeat the process) What skill(s) of mine led you to consider me.  Just because you are a good programmer is not enough, I want to hear we are looking for a specific skill (ie ASP.net developer with WCF And MVC experience.) Where is the position located?  There is no point in even talking about a position in a location I am not willing to move to.  Some recruiters will just give you a general large city,  I want to know if it is down town, in the suburbs, etc.  A real offer has a real location, a fishing trip generally doesn't. Tell me about the position?  If I am not interested at this point I do not give them any more information.  If I have a good lead for them I may ask for contact information to pass along.  I never give my friends/(former)coworkers numbers to the recruiters that I do not have a working relationship with. If I am interested I ask them to send me an email with the information on the position and that I will reply with my resume.  This email should have a reply to address that is from the company they claimed to represent.  I also check out their website and if I have any question I will call the number from the website to contact the recruiter.  This is more about confirming the recruiter is who they claimed they were than getting the question answered."
517,"It can be very beneficial. For the child: This is the child's first exposure to the workplace.  Their parent spends what seems like most of their life there and what they do at work often affects how they are at home.  It can give the child some context to relate to when their parents talk about their day.  It also gives them a glimpse in to what their parent does and how they interact with other adults in a professional setting.  This may be completely different from how they are at home with their friends. For the Employee: It is a parents job to help raise a productive adult.  Part of that is teaching them about work and responsibility as an adult.  Having your child see you actually work is an important part of this.  It also allows the parent to get work done instead of having to take a day off and still spend some time with their child. For the Business: It gets productivity out of what otherwise may have become a lost work day.  It can help keep morale up as one persons lost productivity generally has a negative impact on their coworkers.  Many times children grow up to work in the same place as their parent.  The time spent learning the business now helps to form the bond that leads to this. If the child is bonded to the parents work the parent is more likely to stay loyal to the company, as parents do not like disappointing their children. As has been pointed out it is not always possible.  Many times workplaces just are not safe for children, or the children would be disruptive to the workplace.  But where it is safe and not disruptive, I think it is a good thing for all involved."
518,"The reason people tease about things like that is because they are uncomfortable about what they perceive as a weakness in themselves .  It's a back-handed way of paying you a compliment.  If you have a sharp but witty and playful retort ready, one of two things will happen:  either you will all be having fun together, or it will stop being fun for them."
519,"When should I start looking for my first employment?. I am currently a student in my last year. I will be working as an intern for the next three months, and if everything goes according to plan I will get my degree in five months time. This leaves me unemployed for two months, plus the time needed to find a post-graduation job. Is it alright to start looking for my first employment a few months before I get my degree ? And if it is, what should I write on my resume?"
520,"In over 30 years in the work force, I have seen people give 2 weeks notice, 4 weeks notice and 0 weeks notice (a poor practice in general). I have never seen the replacement hired and onboard before the person left. Even when they are going to hire from within the organization. What you should focus on is not leaving a mess for your replacement. Make sure that everything is organized and put together for the new person to find.  Two weeks is plenty of time to turn your tasks over to someone else (usually someone doing the job temporarily until the replacement is hired) if you are organized. The one place where I would want to give more than two weeks notice is if I had a major project go live the week after that time period or the projected last couple of days. No employer worth going to work for would want you to bail out on your old employer two days before the go live of a major project."
521,"For the most part yes , you can (and should) start looking now, but there may be special cases where an employer won't be able to consider hiring you until you've got a degree.  Since you didn't mention any professional certification (architecture, law, medical practice, etc.) then I'm guessing that's not the case.  My answer is also centered around the practices in the United States. Typically, students just put (expected) next to a future (or current) year on resume/profiles to make this clear: Bachelor of Whatever , Whatever University, 2012 (expected). Getting your degree isn't really a magical date; you are going to see it through and you've already gained much of the experience.  I would start looking now; some employers may even see that initiative as a positive.  As with most things, employers are usually willing to try to work with issues that the candidate is honest about."
523,"Regarding resume: put the degree and when you expect to see it. If nobody did it this way, all new graduates would have to wait months after graduation to get a job. Yes start looking now. With the economy we have had the last few years there is no way to predict how long the search will take. The risk is that you will be applying for jobs that can't wait for you to graduate. But you might gain experience in interviewing. Also your time as an intern to find a job."
525,"We have a daily ""standup"" meeting, although many do sit.  The meeting lasts 15 minutes, no more.  After fifteen minutes, an alarm goes off and it's over.  This seems to be sufficient to keep people on-topic."
526,"My company of about 25 has an unwritten policy that you can bring your kids if there is no where else for them to go, as happens sometimes, especially with single parents. In general they will hang out in our break room where there is a flat screen TV with Xbox and Wii's connected. It's good for the company (Mom or Dad can come to work) and the employee (doesn't miss work).  I don't know how much good it does the kids, but it doesn't seem to hurt them. So far all our kids have been respectful of the adults working here.  If we ever had a kid who was disruptive in some way I can imagine this being a problem. Certainly this solution doesn't scale well if the company were to grown its head count significantly."
527,"Should I file my checklists as documentation?. I keep lots of little checklists of to-do stuff. I used to keep them on a legal pad and I threw away the pages when they were done. Now I use an iPad app, so my history is always stored,but I don't save it in any form of official documentation. I'm a programmer so most of my work is documented via version control, but there's lots of little fixes to non-version controlled software, database changes and check-ups I do as I fill a sort of support role as well. We've been trying to document what we do in my department more so the idea came to me, but my changes aren't the ones that have been causing problems. Should I keep my task list as a sort of official documentation? How would I make sure it's actually useful for someone other than me?"
528,"Maybe. I think the place they would be most useful would be training staff to take on new tasks that they are unfamiliar with. For example, trouble shooting a specific class of problems might involve walking through some steps and using a checklist to eliminate certain situations. A checklist might also be good for tasks such as complicated code deployments or server changes. I've seen simple checklists in the documentation for developer setup guides for setting up the environment for more complex projects. The downside of a checklist is when the person following it is unknowingly on an instance of the task that deviates a bit from what the checklist assumes. Hopefully though, that won't happen until after the person is skilled enough to not need the checklist and make their own decisions. You also want to avoid having people become entirely dependent on the checklist, so maybe don't make it too detailed - maybe write it more as a high-level guidline, unless the specific task will not change and the deep detail is necessary."
529,"I had kind of the same situation at my previous employer.  I ended up just starting to write up in our wiki each time I had a new non-trivial support issue I had to deal with.  It was somewhat enlightening, as there was a significant amount of information that I had just internalized.  Even the tiny issues really assume that you have at least some level of institutional knowledge. It's a pain to do when you start, but afterwards, it's kinda nice as you can take a vacation and maybe get one phone call instead of 3-4 a day. :)"
530,"You might start with the reports compiled by the US government . The annual reports to Congress also provide some useful statistics, such as: In Tables 5 – 7, a greater percentage of teleworkers are shown to be in a somewhat better
position to perform their jobs with excellence than those who are not able to telework. Findings suggest that Federal teleworkers have a clearer understanding of work
expectations (83% versus 79% favorable), are held accountable for results (87% versus
83% favorable), and have a clearer sense of control over work processes (53% versus
44%) when compared with those employees who do not telework as a result of barriers. Positive employee attitudes typically relate to beneficial outcomes for organizations. In a
review of telework research, Gajendran and Harrison (2007) show that participants in
telework are more likely to exhibit job satisfaction and increased performance. Several
EVS items allow beneficial attitudes to be examined, including job satisfaction.  In Table
8, a remarkably larger percentage of teleworkers (76%) are shown to report satisfaction
with their jobs than those who are not able to telework (68%).  ( link )"
531,"I would say you should document everything you do.  If the only documentation is the checklist then yes, it should be saved somehow. A note on terminology though, I'm not talking about ""documentation"" in the sense of someone else referring to it later, I'm talking about a record of your activities, suitable for mentioning at your performance review.  Keeping a list of what you've done will help you put together a statement of accomplishments, and if you've missed important goals it will give you an idea of what other tasks came up that made the goals/deadlines slip."
532,"Actually, I've read that the reverse is true. The first offer sets a baseline and basically a framework to work within. Unless your expectations are way outside the initial range that the employer has in mind, you are better off making the first bid. Even if you are higher and the employer says, ""That's a bit higher than what we have in mind for this position"" you can counter with ""Well what would be more in range?"" They will respond with a higher number than what their initial number would have been and you can counter with a higher number. Of course if you bid far lower and they bite, you're leaving a lot of money on the table, but you've also met your desired amount so in the end you still get what you wanted out of the negotiation. Edit for references I wish I could recall where I read that...I've ripped through a number of books on negotiation and sales over the past year, and at best it would be a wild guess which one of them I picked this up from. But I can tell you from personal experience (over many contract negotiations as an independent consultant) that I've rarely had to take a rate that I couldn't tolerate. And I always lead with my rate when the question comes up. Of course some of my success also comes from applying other strategies. The biggest one for me is being able to walk away from a bad deal. Just the act of saying no thanks increases your bargaining power sufficiently. I've had several callbacks where they were willing to match my requested rate. Of course contract rates and salaries are different scenarios altogether. In a contract, the agent is usually trying to maximize their profit margins, for direct hire, the manager usually has a set budget range for a req. I wouldn't suggest no thanks as a bargaining strategy for direct hires because it will usually be a dead end."
533,Do you have a case tracking system like Bugzilla or FogBugz? I work on a programming team and we use our FogBugz instances for general tasks in addition to bugs/feature requests and it works pretty well.
534,"You should check your companies document retention policy.  Some companies may require you retain them, some require that you do not.  The reason is after a certain amount of time they can be considered discover-able documents for legal proceedings.  These vary by company.  I have worked at companies that considered any document over 5 years a record that required retention.  Even if it was a menu used for take out that had a not scribbled on it. From Wikipedia The retention period of a document is an aspect of records management.
  It represents the period of time a document should be kept or
  ""retained"" both electronically and in paper format. At the termination
  of the retention period, the document is usually destroyed. The term
  is generally used by accountants and tax professionals whose
  occupation involves dealing with legal documents that only need to
  remain in existence for a certain amount of time. The retention period
  varies for different types of records. For example, business
  incorporation documents have a permanent retention period (meaning
  that they should be retained and never be destroyed), but receipts for
  tax-deductible purchases by an individual taxpayer usually have a
  three-year retention period (and can often be safely discarded after
  that point.) The length of the retention period vary by industry and
  are based on the likelihood that the document will be needed at some
  point in the future for ligitation reasons. Records that will serve no
  further purpose (as determined by the length of their retention
  period) are destroyed for space issues, usually by paper shredders."
536,Is there a canonical reference for business cards?. I'm getting fairly close to graduation and thinking that I might make some business cards for when I go to internship fairs and the like. Is there a canonical reference for their design and content?
537,"Hitting a ceiling in my career. I have been in my career for 16 years and I've hit a ceiling where my skills as a developer make me more attractive as a hands on developer than as a development manager. I have successfully lead teams in the past as a ""pseudo-manager"" where I have mentored/trained/managed project and team responsibilities, but I was still expected to take on daily coding tasks. Truth be told, I don't think I'm as effective a coder as I was 5-10 years ago when my eagerness compensated for my limited experience. On the other hand, managers look at my experience and knowledge and would prefer to keep me as a tactical asset rather than strategic. When looking for direct hire positions as a manager, the majority of the jobs have a hard requirement of a degree and/or PMI certification. I don't have my degree and PMI requires a certain number of years as a project manager to even sit for the exam. I guess my question is how do I take my career beyond being a code slinger?"
538,"Modern business cards really have no formal canon anymore - I've seen a range from simple and tasteful to multicolor polka dot with pastel text that made my eyes bleed. What you'll probably be creating are personal / contact cards (referring to you as a person/applicant) so there won't be any company/title information on them, but the ""rules"" are pretty much the same. Wikipedia has an article on some business card conventions , but it's rather sparse. Scobleizer also has some tips which I generally agree with. Some things I personally look for in a business card: Clean layout Tell me the company, the person (and their title/qualifications), and relevant contact info (email, phone, fax, web, postal address). As a general rule don't put your cell phone number on your card - you can always write it in later. The back of your card should be blank. If you absolutely must put something on the back of the card put it in a corner or make it unobtrusive enough that I can still write notes on the card. Legibility Use a font I can read if I'm sitting at my desk, without having to pick up the card. Use colors that are easy to read (Black or a dark color on white or a very light color). If your card has graphics, make sure they don't interfere with legibility! Size Standard business card size, please, or else I don't want it. (You'd be surprised how many people's cards are bigger/smaller than standard. It doesn't make you stand out, it makes me hate you and your odd card!) Composition Good heavy cardstock. White. UNLAMINATED, ESPECIALLY ON THE BACK for the love of kittens please don't hand me a shiny glossy card that I can't write notes on! If you absolutely must have a laminated card, laminate the front ONLY. If I can't jot notes on the back of the card I will hate you. If you can't jot down your cell number on the back of the card for that special recruiter to call you you'll hate yourself. I happen to have two cards from UL on my desk which are pretty nice in my opinion (though one of them commits the unforgivable sin of having a graphic back that you can't write on - it's dark red). I've also included a redacted version of my personal contact card which I hand out when I'm not acting in connection with my employer.  It's a bare-minimum card designed for me to write additional information on, and I have the printing done by a shop on heavy (100#) business card stock"
539,"Keep in mind that some people will scan the cards into a database. The simpler the construct the better. Strange colors and graphics frustrate the OCR software. If you only have cell phone, put it on the card. Don't put contact info that will be useless after graduation. So no college email address, or college phone number."
540,"I think the message has been lost. The idea was to encourage girls to pursue education because of all jobs they could get if they went to college. In many places it is just an open house day, to show families what their parent does at work. When done correctly the payoff is not immediate, the young girls that are inspired are not ready to enter the work force for another 10 years. Plus this is not recruiting them to work for you, so they probably end up working for somebody else."
541,"I think you want to be relatively conservative in the design of your personal cards for most professions. The exception is for people who will be working in the arts. My cards for my day job are very vanilla, the cards I give to gallery owners are a mini-portfolio of my art (see moo.com, if you want to do this) and that way they can pick one they really like to remember me by and I always have a portfolio with me that fits easily in my purse. And proofread, prooofread, proofread. They can't call you if the phone number is wrong."
542,"There are multiple career paths for developers. Project Management, functional management, software/system architecture, and senior development roles. Project Management and functional management, like Development Manager, Team Lead, and CTO, are the management positions, with project management being more about managing project success and functional management being more in-line with team success, both tactically or strategically. I've heard of developers heading into system architect roles, which is really just a senior level technical position that doesn't involve people management as much as it does determining the overall architecture of large systems. Senior development roles are more like the position that you're in. Management likes people like you because you can use your experience to solve complex problems. While technologies do change a lot and you may feel like your coding skills aren't what they were in the past, the concepts behind problem solving are fairly static. I've seen senior developer roles where the senior engineer was more independent, like a sole developer on a one-person team. A position such as this could be a great perk for an experienced developer who doesn't want to move into a management-type position, yet he/she still doesn't want to have the same type of hands-on management that a junior developer might face. You might consider talking to your managers and finding out what your options are; they don't even have to be formal. If you're indeed a valuable person in the organization, they'll find a position for you that both utilizes your skills while also keeping you engaged. Finally, a degree can help you break through this ceiling that keeps you from progressing. Consider discussing with your employer to see if they'd be interested in helping you obtain your PMI. It's not clear which path you're most interested in, but expressing your interest either way may at least let you know where you stand."
543,"normalocity is right that you should just talk to your supervisor.  However, I can give a few guesses as to their motivation: 1) They wanted to make it clear to you that you did something wrong, but didn't think the offense warranted a full demotion with loss of title and pay. 2) They're hoping you'll improve your behavior and plan on giving you the old responsibilities back once that happens, or giving you a real demotion if it doesn't happen - for now they're just waiting to see and saving themselves the paperwork. 3) They didn't think whatever you did was very bad at all, but needed to be able to say they did something in response to the complaint when asked (by the higher management, or the customer in question), so they picked an option that's least harmful to you. In either of the first two cases, it's important that you show effort to improve if you want to avoid more severe consequences; in the last case, it's still important that you at least that you not get any more complaints (though I realize that's not entirely under your control)."
544,"If you are looking at the project manager direction, taking the PMP exam without the years as PM qualifies you for the CAPM . This then gives you a few years to get the ""in the saddle"" experience as a project manager. You may find your local university offers a project management course that meets the project management training required for the CAPM. To get the degree requirement dealt with, you may want to look into first acquiring an associates degree from your local community college, then leveraging that to a 4 year degree at a later time. Most counties have a community college, and most community colleges offer evening classes, some even offer online courses. Many colleges only count courses 7 years old (or less) towards a bachelors, while the associate degree will ""lock in"" the first 2 years of school. This will let you take evening classes at a more leisurely pace suitable for someone with a family. I don't know about your state university system, but here in Colorado (and in my previous state of Florida), the state universities have to admit you (as a transfer student) if you have an associates from a community college in that state. So for older students who have to work and support a family, the community college to associates to state university to bachelors route is the most practical approach to getting that degree credential. I'm an older software developer, and I don't really want to get into managing, so I'm working on a different degree (this won't be my first bachelors) to get credentialed in a different field."
545,"First, you have to figure out if you are a process oriented company or a results oriented company. In a process-oriented company, there are neither heroes nor stars. How you do your work is more important. Coming to work on time, getting the right cover sheet stapled to your TPS report and things like that. There are no favorites, nor stars, in a process-oriented company, and this is the kind of company who will deliberately fire anyone found to be indispensable, or who deviates from the policy manual. A common example of a process-oriented company is a fast food franchise: the goal is for every burger to be the same at every store in the country. If you make a better burger, you'll lose your franchise with them. There is a huge impedance mismatch between the typical software developer and a process-oriented company. In a results-oriented company, stars and heroes are very common. What you get done is more important than how you got it done. When someone complains ""waah, Bob is a prima donna!"" , the answer in a results-oriented company is along the lines of ""Bob gets his product shipped on time, on spec and on budget. What have you done lately?"" It is possible to transform a results-oriented person to fit into a process-oriented company (and vice versa), but the transformation is hard and requires a lot of work that most modern people are unwilling to do (since there is no magic button one could press to do it). not understanding or caring that their work habits are affecting other teams For this issue, one of the more relevant technique that can work with neurotypicals is to try to establish a sense of rapport between the guilty party and their affected victims and then maneuver the person into a sense of guilt. This is not going to work on someone who is a little more aspergery than typical for our profession: inability to empathize is one of the traits of aspergers. Keep in mind that if it weren't for aspergers, there would be no Silicon Valley."
546,"It seems that there's a disconnect here between how your developers see the issue, and how the other departments (or your superiors, or whoever it is that's actually demanding this change) see the issue.  I would suggest trying to bridge that gap, in multiple stages if necessary. First, do the developers agree that there are good reasons for this change? If they disagree, do they have any good counter-arguments, or alternative suggestions? If they do, you should bring those to the management and see if they'll relax the timing requirement - or if they can explain why the alternatives won't work and the counter-arguments don't solve the issue, so that you can go back to your developers and give them a more complete explanation. Continue the back-and-forth as long as necessary/productive. If you get to the point where the developers agree that there are good reasons but just aren't willing to adapt, or they don't think the reasons are good and resent the whole idea, communicate that to management . Explain that you could force the developers to do what is wanted, but it will cause resentment, lower motivation, quite possibly lower productivity or even employees leaving. Make sure the management understands this and still agrees that it's important to enforce the start time (and again, communicate this to your developers), otherwise you may end up responsible for a change that lost the company more than it gained. (A personal note: I've been in the position of being told to come in at a set hour for, as far as the employees were concerned, no good reason, and it's really extremely unmotivating. It's really important to make sure people understand the reasons and don't feel like you're just changing the policy on a whim or because you don't trust them.)"
547,"It sounds like your department is trying to keep better track of who is doing what and what is being done, so towards that end I would say yes, you should keep them. That said, it sounds like in the format they are in, they will not be useful to many other people, as they may be random collections of big and little tasks with little associated information or tags. If there is a concerted effort in your department to track and document more, it does sound like a good time to begin using software for this. One of the huge benefits of using a service like Fogbugz, Teambox, Trello, Pivotal Tracker, etc, is that everything you do becomes searchable to both yourself and any current or future team members. Want to see the first time someone dealt with a particular issue, or if it comes up often? Search for it, and see what comes up. Personally, I implemented Teambox in my workplace, and I encourage my coworkers to use it for collaborative tasks. But I also use it myself for things that only I need to keep track of, knowing that whoever is in my role in the future (even if it's me!) may appreciate this history of how certain things were handled before. Many of these systems are fairly quick and easy to use and integrate a commenting stream do that updates and discussions around a task are stored with that task. Also, if there are repeatable task lists, many of these systems let you store them as a template."
548,"I don't think it's inappropriate to ask , and I doubt any employer would rescind an offer just because you inquired about the possibility - however, it's entirely possible that they can't wait 3 months and will rescind the offer due to that if you insist on delaying your start date instead of just asking if it would be acceptable. So you need to decide in advance whether your new job or finishing things up at the old job is more important to you. On the other hand, it's entirely possible that your new employer will be willing to negotiate and will applaud you for wanting to leave your previous employer in as good a situation as possible (that was my experience when I did something similar). Another possibility, if you have a really good relationship with your current employer, would be to mention that you're planning on leaving before you get any offers, so that they can find and start training your replacement while you're still looking for other jobs. Of course, you'd have to figure out what to do if it turns out you still haven't moved on four months later - this strategy would probably only work in an environment flexible enough that keeping both you and your ""replacement"" on for a while wouldn't be an issue."

How can you accurately and objectively estimate your market value (apart from just leaving and seeing what people will pay you)?"
551,"There are a number of websites that give salary data for positions by location (salary.com or something like that, being one). There is also nothing to stop you applying for jobs elsewhere whilst in your current job and attending interviews to find out what you might get paid, though I would definitely be discreet about it."

My suggestion: document it on a wiki where everyone can see it. You can either put it on a page as an ""official"" procedure for your position or on a personal page. But then at least other people can see it when you are away and take over your tasks. And people in similiar positions across the company can peer review it and exchange ideas. The key is keeping it public and easy to update (and access, even via your iPad)."

There have been many mentions about employees wasting a lot of their time at work visiting Facebook, YouTube and other ""distracting websites"", thus making their productivity suffer.

You will probably be asked why you applied, but you should be able to give a sufficient reason besides ""just looking"". Also posting your resume on LinkedIn, monster... will get some inquiries."
559,"I have never seen a job posting that specified the ""Belbin team role"". I could see how when assembling a project team the team could need people from all these roles. These types would be pulled from current employees. I would be very surprised to see it mentioned in an advertisement. I would be even more surprised to see it mentioned on a resume or CV."
560,"Is there no succession plan in place at your current employer?  Do you not have anybody working with you who knows at least some of what you know and who could, in an emergency, fill in somewhat competently?  That's who you should be training to take over for you when you leave, even if it's not a formal training process.  This is something your managers should be concerned about - if your position is important enough that you couldn't leave without causing a major disruption, then they're opening themselves up to a fairly large risk. As for your direct question, I can't imagine asking for more than 4 weeks notice.  You need to use those 4 weeks to document everything your replacement will need to know when they come in, to have as smooth a transition as possible."
561,"If you want to show it at the bottom (along with other interests, etc.) perhaps along with Briggs-Meyer type, it might be interesting and show your ability to do some self-reflection, but I wouldn't want to see it in the main body of the resume, if for no other reason than that most folks don't know what the heck it is!"
562,"To me, this shows responsibility - but you need to cap it at (say) 4 weeks or so, instead of a normal two week notice.  If some guy told me he needed three months to train his replacement, I would just laugh.  Trust me - you're more replaceable than you think. (As an aside, I once had to delay a start date by six weeks because of a planned trip to Israel (from North America).  You would not believe the ribbing I got for the rest of my time at the new company.  Every time we interviewed someone, people would remark, ""Well, unless he's going to Israel, he should be able to start in two weeks."")"
563,what is the effect of blocking such websites on the employees? One of the effects is that people spend time and effort trying to circumvent these restrictions - at least it appears that way given the number of times the question comes up on Super User.
564,"Here is a search of ""cyberloafing"" and ""psychological engagement"" on Google Scholar, which present findings on the effects of productivity, how attitudes in the workplace are effected, and other topics that you might find useful. It's difficult to summarize the various findings without short changing their explanations, but what many find is that any form of break from regular work a few times during the day is often refreshing, the same way people would physically walk away from their desks to break. Anecdotally, in the places I've worked, usage was monitored, but never brought up as an issue unless there were other indicators that someone wasn't actually getting done what they needed to get done. Otherwise, what we did on the internet (so long as it didn't bring in viruses, or involve illegal file sharing or other activities that might raise the liability of the organization) was considered fine."
565,"There are lots of ways to do this!  Here are some ideas to get you started. Whoever solves this tough problem can leave an hour early on Friday. Whoever takes this unpleasant assignment gets a free lunch. If the team can overcome this obstacle, I'll give you all next Friday afternoon off. Now the only downside to this - and some people really feel this is significant - is that it trains your team to expect rewards beyond the normal rewards of working.  You will need to decide if it's worth it."
566,"How can I measure motivation in an interview?. I've been performing technical interviews for about a year now, and I have learned a lot about what to look for in a candidate. The thing I'm struggling with most, however, is how to gauge a candidate's motivation level. You can determine someone's technical proficiency by asking them technical questions and evaluating their answers. Is there an objective way to determine how motivated someone is/will be? Here are some things I've tried. Some work with some candidates and not with others: Do you work on (field-related) projects outside of work? This one sounds like it would work, but sometimes people are really into their current job and pour all of their effort into that job and not side projects. Should candidates be penalized for this? The other extreme is there too: candidates spend all their time on side projects and don't concentrate on their full-time job. What technical blogs/books have you read recently? This one is actually one of the most helpful ones. If you care about what you're doing, you'll keep up with the technologies you are working with and know what's going on in your field. These are really the only two that provide any insight. Even then, it's a limited view into the person's motivation. Even if they answer both of those questions positively, they may spend too much time on those things and not on their work. So, any suggestions on how to gauge a candidate's motivation level? Or is it just something you have to gamble on? Is the only way to determine this to call references and ask?"
567,"When considering unionizing it is important to realize that the process is likely to be harmful (at least in the short term) to your company and to the workers. While no one can predict the fate of your company if you become
  unionized, you should know that the Teamsters' track record for its
  members keeping jobs is not a good one. Today's unions are a multi-billion dollar per year industry,
  collecting more than $10 billion per year in union dues from workers.
  The majority of today's union-represented employees never voted to
  become unionized but must pay the union or be fired from their jobs.
  Union dues are used to finance the running of the union's business. Source: www.1-888-no-union.com Many companies are forced out of business when they are not able to compete due to added costs required due to the union. I would not consider voting to unionize unless the company is strong and has a solid profitability.  Better to quit a job you hate than cost every one else you work with their job.  Not to mention bringing in a union could just cost you dues and end up costing you pay. These conditions may warrant considering unionization: The company has a history of flouting the laws and regulations regarding safety and employee rights. The company uses false promises and disingenuous incentives to drive goals but has real consequences for not meeting base standards. The company moves employees to positions they are not capable of doing or that are unpleasant to force out employees they do not like, or who are on the verge of retention awards. Things you should not unionize for: Better pay - You will end up losing here.  While you may see an immediate bump in pay you could earn more taking your experience to another company than you will get though unionization. Better benefits - See above. Better working hours - The business has needs.  This is usually one of the first thing the union gives up in negotiations anyway. Because you do not like your company - You will not like your employer anymore in a union shop than you did before.  Causing the company harm will do no good.  You are better off finding a job at a company you do like. There are companies that I have worked at in my life that I feel could or have benefited from unionization.  If I were going to try to organize a union I would try to find one that was not part of a big national union.  These are businesses with their own interests that you can not count on to care about your company, your wages, or your retirement."
569,"Motivation varies so much, based on so many variables, that it's impossible to measure - and even if you could, all you're measuring is their motivation right now with their current set of circumstances.  Many of those motivation variables will change when they come work for you, anyway. I think what you're trying to determine is whether or not they are an effective worker - therefore, your goal should be to determine whether they've been effective in the past.  What they've worked on (either on their own or in their careers), how successful it is, and whether they are excited to talk about it will tell you more than anything about how they work."
570,"What I have noticed is that motivated people accomplish things. They deliver products, they do the hard stuff and they are more than willing generally to tell you about their accomplishments. Note the difference between the following two answers to a question on what you do in your current position: ""I write code to maintain the XYZ system. I do code reviews. I answer technical questions."" ""I just delivered a module that did XYZ last month and it was quite an involved project using a technology that was unfamilar to me. In fact it started from a suggestion I made when I noticed...I had to do a lot of research to pick out the tool to use and I had to solve this really interesting problem...."" Which person do you think is more motivated? Now you generally have to be careful to filter out the BS artists who also can sound very enthusiatic. They however are generally not able to answer technical details when you pursue the questions further and the truly motivated who really did do what they claimed to do can."
571,This is not as simple as it seems. You can get the prevailing wage for your title off of various websites.  But your title may not be an accurate descriptor of your position.  Sometimes a position is under-titled and you are responsible for duties that are typically assigned to a higher grade.  And sometimes you are over-titled and have a title that infers a higher level of responsibility than you really have. You need to look and see what responsibilities are typically assigned to a title to figure out what the title you should refer to for getting your prevailing wage. Next you need to accurately access where your skill set belongs were you to move into a new position.  You may have senior responsibilities but only a year or so on the job.  It is difficult to justify a senior title for someone with only a few years of experience.  Instead if this is the case I would take the added responsibilities to move my salary expectations higher into the normal range. Finally you have to gauge the level of interest in your skill set in the open market in your area.  If you expect to get a raise for your current position you need to have a marketable skill set that allows you to find another job at a higher rate in your area fairly easily.  If there are a glut of people with your skill set looking for work in your area you are going to find it difficult to make a case for any significant raise.
572,"How can I determine if it is unprofessional to play games during lunch hours?. I like to play quick games on my iPad/phone during lunch, and I'm concerned if it gives a bad impression. I'm salaried and get an hour for lunch. I eat in the break room usually, so I'm talking about being with other employees. No one's mentioned anything about it or given dirty looks so far. Our contract explicitly prohibits playing games ""during working hours"" but this is only during lunch hour; that stipulation was put in because someone was playing games on their work computer instead of doing actual work. Generally the office environment is fairly laid back, and our senior programmer also plays games sometimes at lunch. How can I determine if this still gives a bad impression? For what it's worth my boss is always out for lunch, so he never passes by the break room, but many other colleagues do."
573,"Look around the room at lunch. Are others reading books, listening to their MP3 player, reading a newspaper, reading a non-technical magazine, watching CNN? If they are doing these things, and it is your personal phone/iPad why is it different? You could even be playing ""words with friends"" or some similar game, with somebody at the table. If you are in the break room, and you haven't exceeded the allowable break time, why should anybody care? Oh some will, but they will be in the minority."
574,"It is difficult, in my mind, to explicitly quantify ""Motivation.""  It's probably the easiest of the desirable ""soft skills"" to BS in a technical interview. Rather than motivation, I look for passion.  A passionate person can be a motivated person, you just have to be able to get them passionate about the right things.  HLGEM is on the right track with her answer. One of my favorite interview questions is ""Tell me about your most favorite project ever - Dev / Non-Dev, Professional/Personal.""  If the candidate answers passionately then you can infer that they can be motivated.  Conversely, if they answer flatly, I expect to be disappointed. This question also provides a nice vector into conversationally gauging additional problem-solving skills and potentially technical skills as you dive into a deeper discussion about their most favorite project."
575,"Does being on salary only benefit the employer?. As a professional I am almost always a salaried employee.  However, there doesn't seem to be any benefit to the employee for being on salary.  For example, if I miss a day of work my pay is docked, but if I work 10 extra hours during the week I get no benefit at all since I'm exempt and the company doesn't have to pay overtime. It seems to me that the point of being salaried is that you always get the same amount of pay regardless of time, but in practice this translates to ""We don't have to pay you overtime, but you still have to work 8 hours a day"". For all intents and purposes it appears that the whole concept of salaried/exempt employees only benefits the company, who gets to ignore overtime laws, but has no apparent benefit to the employee, who has all the drawbacks of an hourly employee without getting any overtime or ""time and a half"" for working beyond the normal hours. Is there any employee benefit to being Salaried or is it only good for the employer?"
576,"Being on a salary rather than an hourly wage does have it's benefits: Potentially more flexibility over working hours. Possible flexibility over duration and timing of lunch breaks. Higher pay - this is the benefit you get for having to potentially work more hours or at weekends. Time off in lieu for working weekends - this might not be available to a hourly paid employee who'd be getting overtime. Possibly more holiday entitlement. Obviously all of these depend on the employer and would be subject to negotiation. If you weren't offered at least one of these for the requirement to work extra hours then it might be time to consider a change of employer. Original answer, comparing employees to contractors: It depends which country you are in but the benefits of being an employee (as opposed to a contractor) can include: Paid holiday. Paid sick leave - not always available immediately and not always at full rate, but certainly usual in the UK. Pension contributions from the employer. Training paid for by the employer. Promotion to higher pay grades or even different roles (management etc.) While you may be expected to work overtime for ""free"" you should also expect to get paid time off for medical appointments, and a certain degree of flexibility over lunchtimes and even start/finish times. All of these will either be standard or subject to negotiation when you are offered a position."
577,"Your lunch hour is typically ""off the clock"" and tacked onto your working day, so IMO it's acceptable to do anything within reason during that time, especially if it's using your own equipment."
578,"If you're on company premises, you are still representing the company, and should be professional about it.  That means not doing anything that's going to create a hostile environment for others, or is going to embarrass the company in any way if a client/journalist/investor/prospective employee happens to walk by. For most workplaces, that means most games are going to be okay on break, as long as you're in a clearly-defined break area.  Certain workplaces aren't going to be okay with any games on site.  A funeral home, for example.  Certain games aren't going to be appropriate at any workplace due to controversy, like Grand Theft Auto for example.  If you work for a game company, don't play a competitor's game at lunch.  You get the idea.  Just use your best judgement."
579,"I'm one of those old-fashioned interviewers who just directly asks what I want to know: Tell me about a project that motivated you, and why. Tell me about a project that demotivated you, and why. Then listen to which one more closely describes a typical project at your company.  A really good follow-up question about the demotivating project is what techniques they tried to mitigate the issues, or things they might have tried given more autonomy.  Don't kid yourself that every project at your company is intrinsically motivational.  You need employees with coping skills to get things done when the task is important but unfun."
580,"Is a dress code beneficial in a company?. Are there any studies on whether a dress code is beneficial to any/some companies, as opposed to just adopting ""casual Fridays"" all week long?"
581,"What is the preferred way of reporting suspicious behavior by co-workers?. Oftentimes when I fill out a job application, I'm also asked to take a survey where I have to write the best action to take. One question (or something similar) I see pop up on these surveys all the time is: You see a co-worker take something that you know doesn't belong to them. What do you do? I've always written a basic ""report the suspected theft to your supervisor"" response because I really don't feel that confronting them is a beneficial thing for me to do, but something needs to be done. I know it makes me kind of a snitch, but that's just how I feel it should be handled. What I'm wondering is what employers see as the best solution. What do employers want their employees to do in these types of situations?"
582,"Talk to Human Resources immediately. Theft is a Human Resources issue and they'll know the specific policies ect, and by talking to them first you'll know what you need to do. Call them and tell them you need to speak to them privately; you don't need to say why aloud. Close the door when you're talking to them and tell them why you're talking to them (about a suspected theft/ect) before you divulge the specific details; if you need to talk to someone else instead due to company policy, they'll know what to do. If you're concerned about a reputation as a ""snitch"" ect. ask your HR person what they can and can't keep confidential about your conversation; they may be required (by law or by company policy) to pass along certain information they get from you."
584,"The only way I could see this giving a bad impression would be if everyone else worked over lunch (or took much shorter breaks to get back to work quickly) - then they could think you're being less productive by playing games over lunch, although it'd still depend on what time you came in and left, etc. If it's purely a question of what you're doing over break when everyone else is doing something non-work-related too, and you're playing on a personal device (and not on the big screen on the breakroom wall), I really doubt anyone reasonable would care. Of course, there are some people out there who still think ""games are for teenagers"", but that's very different from giving a bad impression to the majority."
585,"As chad said the term beneficial is fairly broad, however I'll take t to assume you mean beneficial in the sense your employees are happier and hence more productive and hence provide greater benefit to the company in regards to their output => money value. I'm not aware of any studies (I'm sure there are some though) but it would be my opinion that different professions have the impression of requiring different levels of dress.  For example if I saw a group of of lawyers in the office wearing shorts and shirts my first impressions might be one of un-professionalism.  However if I saw a builder coming to work in their sunday best I might be a bit concerned. Basically to some degree society has dictated our dress sense in the work place.  However I've always worked best when I could wear what I felt comfortable at the time and felt like I had the support of the company to make the right decision if I had to dress more approprietly i.e. meeting a customer for an important business deal and they wear suits to work. I've never really been a fan of dress down fridays.  I've preferred a fairly loose dress standard all week with the emphasis put on the employee to ensure they dress appropietly.  I guess there would be a certain standard but it would be flexible enough to cover those who enjoy wearing jeans to work over those who enjoy wearing dress pants and suit etc In summary.  I believe dress standards can have an effect on performance if people dress casual then they relate that into working casual.  However it can also be determined on society expectations as well as the individual.  Dressing casual (or smart) just might be one way to get the best out of the team and help develop the kind of work atmosphere your looking for."
586,"It was always my impression that salary wages were always advertised higher (pay scale wise) than standard hourly wages (may not be the case I guess) for the fact that you may be occasionally called upon to do those extra bits of work. In a good company I always liked salary as it gives me the impression to a certain degree that I have control over my hours and how I get my work done.  I don't have to watch the clock and if I want to leave 15mins early or arrive 30mins late that would be ok.  I will be making up the time somewhere.  This kind of flexibility is something I really look for in a company.  Of course it then requires me to ensure I don't abuse it and make sure I still do the work, but if I enjoy my job then that won't be a problem.  Alternatively if I work an extra hour overtime, I should be confident enough to take an extra hour over lunch without having to worry about my time. If you find yourself consistently doing extra hours then that to me raises a warning flag that something is not quite right in the work balance.  Working extra hours shouldn't be the norm or expectation in a workplace. In the end, if your company has a good ""employee"" focus and you manage your time well both personally and with your boss, being a salaried employee IMO can have equal benefits to both the employee and the company."
587,"Well, casual Fridays all week would mean they aren't casual any more, right? Most companies, depending on the type of services they provide, need some sort of dress code to appease customers. In a suit and tie environment, casual Fridays may be casual but still implies some sort of dress code, e.g. no shorts and flip flops. It gives the folks a chance to relax a bit (especially for the women I think) but doesn't really significantly degrade the overall impression that a customer might get. If all days were casual days, I think the variance between what is acceptable and what is not rapidly gets out of hand because there is no longer any ""standard"" and humans being what we are will gradually ""down-dress"" until management eventually gets pissed off and steps in anyway. Only difference is by that time, egos get bruised."
588,"""Does this still give a bad impression? For what it's worth my boss is always out for lunch, so he never passes by the break room, but many other colleagues do."" I think this is the crucial line. If you are even thinking about it, it means you don't find it totally comfortable as well. Honestly, if that's the way you feel, whether or not the boss really feels that way becomes irrelevant and you should stop. I play games during lunch breaks on my phone and I'm quite comfortable doing that. So much so that I only pause it when my boss wants to talk to me about something. I feel no real guilt because my work is up to date and even if I'm a little behind, I'm confident he knows me well enough to trust me to get back to schedule. Now if I'm behind on my work and it's a reasonable schedule (or if I really feel no need to de-stress), I would be working even though it's what's left of my lunch hour because I think that's the right thing to do for ME . TL;DR , if you are feeling guilty, try to figure out why. Until you get the ""why"" part sorted, you will never really be comfortable."
589,ANY assessment is fine as long as: It's standard for everyone applying for that post. It's not significantly biased in ways that would make people frown. Some cultural bias is fine since your customers or working environment might depend on that. You actually bother to tell them the answers or at least explore there answers with them. Giving someone a test and not exploring the answers with them is pretty often just a waste of time.
590,"Actually, you might consider talking to them first, if you know then and get along well. After all, it might be a misunderstanding. Maybe they actually loaned object in question to the company and are taking it back, or maybe it's a piece of old equipment which they bought from the company. Also, if it is something of low value, I'd consider addressing it directly, rather than making it a big deal. But if it is clearly criminal behaviour, then reporting to the supervisor indeed seems like the only viable action. I would not see this as ""snitching"" - by harming the company, they are also harming their colleagues, who may have to bear part of the consequences for the company, such as financial problems."
591,"The rule of thumb I have always heard is that you should generally stay for at least two years - otherwise it might raise a red flag when people read your CV. Of course, if you have a good reason, <2 yrs may still be OK. Apart from that, there are no general rules. I depends on both what you want (do you prefer stability, or frequent new challenges), on what your job offers, and on industry practices. Some employers consider anyone who stays less than a decade a job hopper, and in some consulting companies, the majority of people is expected to leave after a few years. Also note that there are alternatives to changing jobs, such as moving to a different department, doing consulting work as part of your job, getting a side job (with employer's permission of course), etc."
592,"Optimal office size: cubicles versus small rooms versus open plan?. Possible Duplicate: Is there evidence to suggest that certain office layouts are better than others for productivity? Which of these three (and possibly others) are most beneficial to a company, in terms of employee productivity: cubicles small offices (say 1–3 people each) or open-plan offices (typically 10–20 people)? Has anyone studied this? (I've worked in small and open offices and find them useful in that I can speak with colleagues directly, but if two colleagues are having a conversation close by, it is hard not to be distracted. I've never worked in a cubicle, but I would imagine it is easier to go off interneting for an hour without anybody else noticing.)"
593,"Are you asking what you should really do, or what you should say on the application? On an application you may not know the procedures of the company, so I would suggest being a little vaguer. Mentioning HR when applying to a small firm that doesn't have an HR department might tag you as a big-company rules-stickler who won't fit in to their small folksy ways. Mentioning a specific job title like supervisor, foreman, or manager might raise hackles if in that company, you'd be messing with the chain of command going to that person. So I'd say something like ""discreetly report it to the appropriate person as soon as possible."" As to what you should do in real life, it would depend on what was being taken (Joan's lunch? Steve's red stapler? A box of printer paper or pens? Cash from the petty cash box?) and where it was being taken (to a desk to be used? or home?). If one co-worker is stealing private possessions from other coworkers, or stealing items from the company for personal use, then that's just not acceptable. I mean maybe a pen or two might happen to go home in a pocket, but nothing beyond that. However taking ""the good mouse"" or ""the nice ruler"" to your own workstation is not the same thing at all. So the interview question ""taking something that didn't belong to them"" is insanely vague. If something's not acceptable, it has to be acted on. It would usually be ridiculous to start with the police (though if a coworker took car keys and drove off in someone's car, I would call 911) so your boss or a neutral third party like HR is the way to go in non-emergencies. If you're concerned that the consequences of that would be too severe for the offense (firing for yogurt-taking) then you can confront the person directly or anonymously (Eg leave a note that says I know who took the yogurt and if it happens again I will report you ) although people may just laugh. And worrying about being a snitch? The workplace isn't high school, where there's a students-vs-teachers vibe, or prison for that matter. You're all on the same team. There may be places that are line-vs-management but I don't want to work in them. I recommend you don't think that way at all."
594,"According to Norbert & Diane Schmitt 's academic text , jobs that require teamwork (increasingly common) are best performed in an open office. Quote below with my emphasis : How does a redesigned work space positively affect employee productivity? Studies suggest that work space, by itself, doesn't have a substantial motivational impact on people; rather, it makes certain behaviors easier or harder to perform. In this way, employee effectiveness is enhanced or reduced. More specifically, evidence shows that work space designs that increase employee contact, comfort, and flexibility are likely to positively influence motivation and productivity. For instance, Amoco Corporation in Denver reported a 25 percent decrease in product cycle time (the time required to make its products), a 75 percent decrease in formal meeting time, an 80 percent reduction in duplicated files, and a 44 percent reduction in overall space costs after offices were redesigned to facilitate teamwork. Based on the evidence to date, an approach that matches office space to the sophistication of the work required is probably best. Jobs that are complex and require high degrees of concentration are likely to be made more difficult by noise and constant interruptions. Such jobs are best done in closed offices. But most jobs don't require quiet and privacy. In fact, quite the contrary, jobs today increasingly require regular interaction with others to achieve maximum productivity. This is probably best achieved in an open office setting."
595,"I have no idea how to get the cream of the crop if that is what you are looking for. Most of the smaller companies have very little chance of nabbing them and keeping them for extended periods of time. But if you are looking for a ""normal"" developer who: Might be a little raw but has the potential to get better. Will tend to be a bit more motivated to learn and get involved. Might stick around for a while. Will be good enough to get ""normal"" jobs done somewhat competently after some learning. Try schools. We are a small-ish software house in a small urban area and schools are pretty much the ONLY source of talent. Of course there will be some risks you are taking with fresh graduates and interns but we find that it works well enough for us. Most won't have the skills necessary right off the bat but they can be taught and are mostly willing to listen. They also come with less cultural baggage and most will stay at least a year (because anything less looks ugly on a resume :P) as long as you will have them. It works pretty well for us after we figured out that no matter what you do, staff turnover is inevitable. Constantly having two ""trainees"" taught how to do things correctly makes dealing with it less painful since they can step in and do the job with a short ""ramp up"" period. They already know most of the general code base, conventions, how we work, what we expect, what we are producing, etc, etc. So it's a lot easier than having to deal with a new developer. They don't cost a lot and those that work out well (you should be able to tell in a month) are enticed to stay. Those that obviously won't get cut early. So we basically end up with a system that is engineered to deal with 1 or 2 people leaving yearly out of our 12 man developer pool. People come, people go, life goes on. One side benefit is that when it's time for the next round of graduates, some of the trainees on hand will recommend friends that are typically of a reasonable quality and the students know that you are serious hirers because news travels fast in small communities. After a few years of doing this, we have students that pro-actively approach us for jobs in their senior year and we actually get to pick from the best of the ""new"" crop because of our reputation. This wouldn't have been possible before we started doing this actively."
596,"I think the answer depends entirely on your personality - whether you have a lot of self-discipline or not. If you do not, you will probably over time tend to cut the day short, make longer breaks or procrastinate, pushing the work into the weekend. This may or may not be acceptable for the company provided this does not affect your coworkers."
597,"My answer comes from the following experience: over the last 15 years or so, I've had jobs in which I telecommuted anywhere from 1 day a week to full-time, for a range of companies from those that had an office space where people worked on-site to those that had one in name only (to meet clients and pick up mail), for big organizations and small ones.  I currently work for a company that has an office space, people work in it consistently, but several people -- be they regional sales or technical developers -- live thousands of miles away.  Those of us who do live close by tend to telecommute a couple days a week because we can. All of that being said, I firmly believe that ""how do I look like I'm doing a good job"" or ""how do I look like I'm effective"" -- which is the root of your question -- is completely dependent upon the industry, individual job, and most importantly the expectations set forth by the company allowing you to telecommute .  By that I mean that if a company offers telecommuting possibilities, it is their responsibility to understand that there is a reason your position is suited for it, and to hold you to standards that are reasonable given your location (and not hold you to standards that are unreasonable). For example, if a company allows telecommuting but does not embrace conference calls, Skype calls, Google Hangouts, or other synchronous means of ""being present"" for required meetings, then that should not be a black mark against you. And in that situation, I might not take them up on the telecommuting opportunity because I would be setting myself up for failure no matter how great I might be at my job.  Similarly, if you are telecommuting and your company requires ""presence"" in meetings and you don't attend (for some value of ""attend"") then that should be a black mark against you. It's a two-way street, but both parties need to know how to read the map. As far as the work itself, if your company has good internal practices for making processes and product transparent -- e.g. if you're a developer and you check in your code and update your bugs/tickets/tasks assignments regularly and accurately, or if you're a project manager consistently updating communication plans and other documents, etc -- then as a remote worker continue to use those practices.  If a company does not already have a way in which work is made transparent to colleagues (even if it's limited just to those colleagues who need to know), regardless of where you are sitting, then as a remote worker your job is necessarily harder and there's nothing you can do about that besides try to implement transparent processes (and then follow them) and again consider if that is a telecommuting situation you want to get yourself into. My expectations as a manager are that everyone should be present (for some value of ""present"") when and where they are supposed to for meetings -- which should be as limited as possible anyway -- and the systems we have in place for showing progress should be used and should show progress. Those expectations are the same regardless of where a person sits. Now, here's the point where you have to make a choice: Do you take a telecommuting position, or telecommute n number of days per week, when you know the company is not really set up for you to succeed while doing it? This is basically the point at which you decide whether or not the extra work you will have to do to prove you are doing the good job that you are, is or is not something that would inherently mess up your work-life balance. Let's assume that all of those real (and unfortunately common) issues can be put aside, and imagine you are now working remotely for some number of days per week for a company that understands what that means and your productivity isn't questioned. The steps for ""separat[ing] or integrat[ing] your work and home life"" are as follows: Stop worrying about proving your productivity and just be productive. Remember why you wanted to work remotely in the first place. The answer to #2 is going to put you on a track to figuring out how best to balance work and life, because the answers are different depending on the reason you're doing it. For example (and these are generalities but still show the overall point): If you're telecommuting primarily because you live far from the
office (or the commute to the office is possible but unbearable),
then do what you can to mimic the office structure in your home: have
a separate workspace, keep consistent hours, make work the priority
during those hours. If you're telecommuting primarily because there are domestic needs to
attend to -- children and their schedules, for example, or
health-related situations, or elder care, whatever the case may be --
then all of the above is still true: keep a separate workspace, keep
consistent hours, and make work the priority during those hours.  In
these cases, ""consistent schedule"" can mean totally different hours
on different days, but as long as it's consistent week to week then
everyone (including yourself) knows how to integrate with the
schedule.  It becomes (or should become) no different than any
other standing meeting -- ""Jim has to pick up the kids from soccer at
4 every Wednesday"" vs ""Jim has a meeting at 4 every Wednesday"" is not
materially different; it's still time people schedule around. Clarity, transparency, and consistency by both you and your employer is what makes telecommuting a success for all -- you get to be productive, the company gets to reap that productivity.  For some, a hard split between Work and Home will be necessary, for others, it won't -- it might not be best to focus so much on the hard separation and instead work on a comfortable integration ."
598,"How to establish a mentoring culture in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment. Earlier I read a question called How to mentor a Junior Developer and thought about this question. I worked as a support engineer at a smaller startup in one of my previous employments where I was the second member of our team. It was a stressful job as a lot of stuff was new and we had multiple responsibilities. It was a rewarding experience to be able to help new members to get up to speed. Getting them up to speed mostly meant to bring them to a comfortable level for all day to day operational tasks. Further product related knowledge was imparted to them by relevant teams. Since this process was being repetitive, we proposed a kind of mutual mentoring system where recent hires who got up to speed with one area would help other recent members come up to speed with other area. This did not work well after some time as the management was not too keen on having new members waste time training others instead of working on tickets right away. Then we adapted to a hands-on working sessions method with seniors having the new members shadow them while they worked on tickets. Once new members understood the nuances of handling the issues, they were assigned tickets with the ticket priority being increased each week or so. This was successful in terms of the knowledge exchange, but proved difficult for the senior members as they were being additionally burdened with their own work loads. This was viewed as a failure on our part by the management. We wished to have an effective mentoring system to counter the work loads and facilitate better knowledge exchange for the new comers, but we were not able to create a better system. What approaches would you recommend for setting up mentoring systems for fast paced environments?"
599,"I am working in a company that moved 3 times. We had 2 different setup : 5-6 people per office. This seems to work fine. It was a team per office (SW team in one office, HW team in another, etc). all in one big office (current setup). This setup is bad (in my opinion). The sales people are very noisy. People are walking by. Distraction all over. Try to group people within the same team. It depends on how big teams are, but they should be close, and the number of people in the office should be small enough not to distract each other."
600,"This isn't a direct answer but, since I posted the question, I've worked out a rather neat workaround. I contact the team leader (face to face or, if not possible, via instant messenger) in advance and say, ""I'm currently working on X . If I keep working on it instead of coming to the meeting I can be done by Y o'clock. My input for the meeting is Z . Would you prefer I came in person or continue with this task?"" This probably won't work every day, but every time it does is, for me, a bonus."
601,How do I push a product I've been told to push to customers without being pushy about it?. I've been told push a particular product to customers if at all possible. I'm okay with promoting it since it is a good product but I also hate when retail floor people come up to me and try and push something to me if I so much as glance in the direction of the product or am remotely associated with it. How should I go about pushing this thing without seeming like I'm pushing it?
602,"How important are higher degrees in a tech industry?. How important are higher degrees in a tech industry? Asides the obvious cases of very specialised companies that perform their own high tech research, does having different levels of higher education benefit the applicant (comparing for example, someone that has a collage degree, to BSc, MSc, D.Sc)?"
604,"Having a great Knowledge Management solution could help solve the problems you've mentioned. Your problem is less about professional mentoring and more about actual job training. A knowledge management solution could involve an editable Wiki, Google Site, Google Docs, or other platforms where you can document procedures. A good knowledge management ticketing system like Zendesk or a Wordpress theme like nowLedge . Additionally, some tasks are better described using audio and video. Many organizations are turning to Youtube and video recording software to capture training sessions. Additionally, screen capture software like CamStudio or Captivate may help record activities on the screen for later educational use. You say much of the training is repetitive. If that is the case, then I agree with senior management. Keep in mind that many startups are on a budget. Every cent counts and must be put towards activities that will pay dividends. Use a combination of these methods to achieve your goals while still avoiding the wastefulness of repetitive tasks."
605,"I would be looking at definite things that your product does to help that person and mention those, also listen to your potential customer and take their information on board. Not only will that help your product in the future but the customer will remember you and your company as approachable. If you need to do the hard-sell then do you have the right product for the person? Does it make its own purpose clear? If not then you might want to mention this to your company."
606,"It seems that higher education never hurts, but beyond that, it's hard to say how important it is. Really depends on what you're after in your career. It can be absolutely critical, it can be less important, but I'm not sure how to quantify it without applying it to something more specific."
607,"This isn't an exact science, so this isn't fool-proof, but I like to ask things like ""what's your favourite thing about X and why?"" where X can be the language they'll be working with or have a lot of experience with, or a project, framework, etc. Basically, something that the candidate has worked with a lot. I usually follow that up with ""what do you hate the most about X and why?"". There's often room for some follow-up discussion, depending on how the candidate responds. When I ask these, I'm not necessarily looking for a reasonable answer (although it helps if I can tell that the candidate isn't just making stuff up), but rather for how they answer. A person with higher motivation/passion tends to have a more interesting answer because they tend to think about stuff like this. If nothing else, you might get a glimpse into whether or not they have thought about why they like/dislike something, or if they're more likely to latch on to a fad or trash talk a technology without being able to discuss its pros and cons."
609,"Well it depends on the following points - which kind of business you are in do your employees contact the customer face-to-face or not What kind of corporate culture is in your company (such as more
formal, less formal, average etc.) There can be more points added to the above list. If you are in service industry and your employees meets the customer frequently such as in banking and finance industry, a strict dress-code is must (Can be relaxed a bit for operations and processing guys). Generally in IT industry dress codes are more relaxed(Not for Business development guys). So until unless we have a subject industry, we can not say whether it's beneficial or not to have a dress-code in our company."
610,"The question can best be answered by a company that has this policy, but I have worked with some organizations that tried, but failed to use it. In a 40 hour work week, 8 hours will be used not to goof off but to productively goof off. In one organization, the amount of documentation required for this 20% meant that 4 hours of it were lost to paperwork. One group expected employees to put in 60 hours a week, therefor nobody knew if it was supposed to be 48 hours of work and 12 hours of experimentation; or 60 hours of work and then experimentation tacked onto the end of the week. The idea that the company or employee is to track the hours so it can be used to level the workload makes it sound like a administrative nightmare. It also means that the employee knows that management is tracking the time, and that management decides what projects are worth playing with. If it didn't sound like fun, or at least less stressful compared with the other projects, I would not be interested in it."
613,"How should a candidate approach an interview for an internal position as opposed to an external position? . How should a candidate approach an interview for an internal position as oppose to an external position? An internal position is a vacant position that is available within the company you are currently working. An external position is outside the company. Several aspects such as process leading up to the interview, position intel and culture intel would be key differences. This is from the perspective of a candidate."
614,"For the most part, there's no difference at all.  You should go into the interview expecting just as much scrutiny as someone who has never worked for the company.  However, you should also be prepared to demonstrate how your inside knowledge of the company is an asset, and not just expect the interviewer to assume as much. I've never interviewed a current employee, but I've interviewed two former employees who left for educational reasons then came back to apply for a higher-level position a few years later.  One couldn't remember anything about our products or what she worked on before.  The other was able to talk intelligently about his previous work here, and demonstrated ability beyond what was required in his former position.  Guess which one we hired?"
615,"The only difference I would expect is that the folks conducting the interview will probably know you (or in a bigger company, know someone in your supervisory chain) - the interview is less of a ""getting to know the candidate"" event and more of a ""Do you have the requisite skills?"" / ""Can we afford to lose you from where you are?"" kind of thing. Because of this you should expect to be grilled a little more thoroughly on your weak points, and you should have a plan on how you will continue to grow and improve as an employee. The benefit side of that equation is that when you state some of the projects you've worked on there's a good chance the people interviewing you will be familiar with them.  If you've done consistently good work for the company you can expect that other teams will want to have you as an asset."
616,"I work in a company that considers itself a 'results oriented workplace', sometimes called ' results oriented environment .' A ROW team rejects the factory model of employment in which managers and foremen are paid to ride herd on a factory floor of sheep like children who cannot be trusted. [Aside: In the US defense contractors are pretty much forced into Taylorism by government contract requirements.  This may account for the common huge cost overruns and frequent missed delivery dates.] The factory model work environment is sometimes called 'Taylorism', after Fredrick W Taylor . A software team working in a Taylor type structure could not implement Google's 20% concept, the time tracking alone would be very expensive and distracting. Since many, probably most, of the 20% projects never result in near term profits a Taylor style company would not continue the experiment for long. I've never worked at Google, but I suspect they are a ROW type organization.  I suspect that Google developers work with their team leaders to lay out a schedule of expected results, which takes in to account the developers 20% projects.  I suspect that as long as a developer delivers results more or less according to the agreed on (not imposed on) plan there isn't any worry about how long someone took for lunch or if they spent 9 hours last week on their 20% project."
617,"if I miss a day of work my pay is docked This means you are really hourly . You should keep copies of all your timesheets/timecards and you may wish to examine your state's labor agency to get paid for missed overtime. Many companies are able to get away with this sort of behavior because they depend on their employees being ignorant of state and federal laws. Some enterprising lawyers are making large amounts of money with this sort of litigation, especially when adding RICO to FLSA 29 U.S.C. § 213 a(17) any employee who is a computer systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker... {snip} and
  who, in the case of an employee who is compensated on an hourly
  basis, is compensated at a rate of not less than $27.63 an hour. http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/29/8/213 I work 10 extra hours during the week I get no benefit at all since I'm exempt and the company doesn't have to pay overtime. In the event that you are not going to file for back pay, a smart company would uses these timesheets to more accurately estimate the amount of effort it takes to get jobs done. If managers continue to estimate it takes 4 weeks to get a task done, and the people working on the task all work 20 hours of overtime each week, then it really takes 6 weeks to do the task - and future estimates should be adjusted accordingly."
618,"When should I inform management that I have been approached by a competitor?. My main gig is as a web developer in a company that builds web applications for a niche market, and about 90% of the market is split between us and another, considerably larger company. Recently I was approached by our competitor and although I work full time and am quite happy with my company, I'm technically a freelancer and wouldn't want to miss what could be a great networking / job opportunity. The competing company is the parent of a group of companies, and they've approached me via one of their companies that don't directly compete with us, so at this point I can't even be certain that they want me to work on their competing application, or something completely unrelated. At which point should I inform management that I'm taking a meeting with them? Before, after, or when (and if) I have a solid offer in my hands? I have no legal/contractual obligations to inform my current company of anything (at least that's what my lawyer said when we discussed my contract for unrelated reasons)."
619,Good question.  The issue is the purpose of the meeting.  There are some companies that under the guise of a job interview perform debriefs of competitor's employees so let's assume that it's a genuine job interview for the moment. The question on when to inform your management that a competitor is attempting to contact you is actually a problem on how good is your relationship is with the management.  If you have good relationship and you want to stay with the company you could inform them immediately just to say you have no interest in the company.  On the other hand if you genuinely have no interest in the competitor you could simply refuse the meeting and not tell management at all. There is another possibility and that is you do want to make a move.  In this case you do not tell management at all.  The industry especially in a close geographic area usually tend to have same people cycling between companies or have people from one company that had worked with managers from another company and depending on how vindictive they could be they could simply kill your chances of getting a job at a competitor out of spite.  (Yeah it's been known to happen). There is a 3rd possibility:  You can potentially use the job offer from a competitor as leverage on your current contract to get a better compensation.  In this case I would suggest holding off telling anyone until you have a concrete job offer in hand with better pay then your current one. So in summary you should first decide what you want to do and then your actions will become clearer.
620,"While I admire the honor you wish to comport yourself with, you are in a strictly business relationship with your current source of income.  Because they have not committed to you for any specific amount of time, you have no professional obligation to advise them at any point prior to your decision to end your business relationship. If I were going to have discussions (directly or indirectly) with my current contact's competition I would make sure there is no appearance of impropriety.  I would do so as a natural breaking point is about to occur, such as before an extension is offered, or likely to be offered.  If at any point the discussion veers towards the unsavory(prying for business intel) I would terminate the meeting.  The company is not going to respect you if you give them the secrets of your former employer even if you not you are obliged to keep them.  And any company attempting to get them from you has no real intent to do right by you. Once you have made the decision to leave, I would inform your current company with in the terms of your contract.  I would not advise them of your intentions for the future beyond that they will not be included in them.  Going to work for the competition will not engender good will.  I would make certain that I left with good form and that my work was above expectations."
621,"How should I approach a co-worker on matters of personal hygiene?. It's a rather delicate issue that I had to deal with once or twice in the past, and can't really say I handled it effectively. I'm a bit crude, and socially awkward and would pretty much prefer to avoid such discussions with co-workers/employees. I've managed to avoid the issue by delegating it 1 , but that trick can't work every time. What would be preferable, a direct discussion with the co-worker in question, a casual reference to the issue in abstract terms in a meeting, or the implementation of a company wide policy on personal hygiene (if it doesn't exist)? Or something else? This isn't a current issue, as right now I'm mostly working from home and solely responsible for any odours. ;P 1 My favourite management technique."
622,"I'm going to attempt to answer the following: Or how could a software development organization implement a similar
  '20% project' concept that would be acceptable to management,
  customers, and employees. As I see it,  implementing such a thing in a workplace would require getting over several roadblocks. You have to realize that this a business decision and thus must be something sellable to senior management in business terms. First, how is the salary of the developer currently paid for? If, as in the place I work, the majority of the developer time is charged to client specific projects, 20% of the time spent on non-billable work is going to be a tough sell. The money to pay those salaries has to come from somewhere and any proposal to do this will have to specify from where. I see three basic choices: the company takes it from current profits, the company raises the hour rate charged to the clients to be able to pay for it or the company pads the hours changed to the client by 20% (which may or may not be legal). If you do not do client billable work, then the first choice is your only choice. If you do then the second may be viable if (and it's a big if) it is unlikely that you will lose clients when you raise your rates. The third option seems to me to not really be viable and I wouldn't suggest it unless I knew it was legal. However to sell the proposal, you have to show what they will get for the money. It's simlar to R&D in a pharmaceutical company. It is big risk and a big cost  with a potentially huge payoff. But how to determine if it did have a payoff? Well that's where you have to track the personal projects. So if you propose such a thing, make sure to devise a system for personal projects that get implemented to be tracked and cost savings or new profits from them tracked. You are going to have to quantify the potential benefits in business terms. Talk in terms of ability to attract the best talent, lower costs due to higher employee retention, and of course the potential profits discussed above. Next you have to show how the hours will be used and how project planning will have to be adjusted to allow for the time. This means that deadlines will move out which again is not an easy sell. I would suggest up to 20% of the hours charged in a month vice a week would make the most sense. And yes if you didn't do it that month you would lose it except under extraordinary circumstances which would be decided one at a time by management. You might also consider slotting some or all of the time in as a rest period between major projects. It's a little easier to tell outside clients that none will be available to work until June 1 and the project will take 40 work days than to tell them it will start May 15 and will take 48 work days. Some of this would have to consider how you currently do business. Teams mostly in maintenance mode would not have that kind of easy to define down time, but with shorter projects, it is probably easier to find the hours on a weekly basis. You also have to address, Do we buy more people or move deadlines out to account for the extra 20%."
623,"Seeing the ""real"" accomplishments of my work. I'm a junior employee in my field of work (web programming, four years) and so often my day-to-day challenges are usually technical and not so much into the managerial or logistical kind. I'd figure the latter stuff doesn't take center stage as much until you take on a more senior role at work. There are cases where I would want to actually see my work as something as a true ""accomplishment"" or a real game changer for the intended client. I get a positive buzz for every nerve racking bug I fix, but I hardly notice about results such as increasing production within a department, or improving conversion rate or sales for a particular client. I feel like my work might get lost in the shuffle of just being another website completed. For most places, getting products finished and on time is the minimum requirement for success. In order to really impress you must do more than the minimum. But it's extremely rarely that clients follow up with our managers saying how our work has given positive long term results. I don't get the end of that news. Nothing about ""guess what, our client X is taking in 15% more sales after the new re-design"" or ""our email campaign brought 200 new customers for company Z"". I'm currently looking to other companies to change jobs, and at interviews I want to impress with talking about how a certain project benefitted a client, rather than just going on the technical details of what I did in the project. Does it seem hard to come by for a junior worker? How should I approach managers about getting business metrics when it's relevant to the work I do?"
624,"Ideally you can refer this problem to your HR department.  They are trained in dealing with people in  ways that avoid harassment and communicate effectively your concerns with out the conflict that can arise when peers criticize lifestyle choices. If this is a chronic problem and you do not have an HR department, then I would sit the offending individual down and let them know this is a professional office and these are the expectations as far as personal hygiene go.  I would request that the individual rectify the issue before returning to work.  And repeat this process immediately when a problem is noted from this point on.  It should not take to many days of short pay, and trips home to shower, before the problem either goes away.  If the problem persists you will need to make a decision about either accepting the poor hygiene or taking other HR Type measures."
625,"When should I ask for more money in conjunction with more responsibility?. So, six months ago, I changed jobs for one primary reason - to spend more time with my family. I negotiated a flex arrangement, and set about to work.  The good news is, I've been doing good work. The great news is that I've done such a good job, I've been told that I will be promoted to team lead, probably today at the 4:00 meeting. The bad news is, I'm back to doing a lot of work, and I'm getting the reduced salary for it.  From 40 hours, I'm back into the 60 hour a week range. I really want the team lead role - it's a hole in my resume that at this point in my life I should really fill.  As such, I can't really decline the additional work and feel comfortable with that decision. The question I have then is this: At what point should I say, ""Okay, I'm doing a lot more work - I should be getting a lot more money?"" In some ways, I would like to have been asked if I want the promotion, for I would have asked them this question at that point. (You want me to promote me? Thanks! How much of a raise does that come with?) I also don't know when our regular reviews are. What would be a good amount of time to wait to bring up the fact that my significantly increased responsibilities should be concomitantly increased?"
626,"Maybe I'm naive, but it seems obvious that a big promotion to team lead will bring with it a commensurate salary increase. I'm guessing there'll be some sort of sit-down meeting with you and your boss, possibly HR.  If, somehow, nobody mentions any sort of salary change, then by all means bring it up.  Tactfully, but definitely bring it up. It could be something as simple as ""Can we discuss a salary adjustment, to go with these increased responsibilities I'll be tending to as team lead?"" or ""May I ask what you were thinking for a new salary to go with these new responsibilities?""  But again, wait until the last minute; it's very, very likely someone in management will bring it up first."
627,"I prefer to wait to ask for an increase until I've actually demonstrated that I can handle the new responsibilities.  I find that it makes for a much more compelling case when I start the conversation to justify a pay increase.  It also shows your bosses that you're not ""just in it for the money"" (regardless of whether or not you actually are...)"
628,"What would be a good amount of time to wait to bring up the fact that my significantly increased responsibilities should be concomitantly increased? A good amount of time is equal to zero. It should be clear whether the promotion leads to an increased salary, and if yes, to what amount. If nobody mention it during the review, then you should immediately raise the question up."
629,"Part of being a manager is dealing with unpleasant things like this. It's your job. That's why you're getting paid even though you don't actually produce anything tangible. You deal with it by being direct with the person in question, and just letting them know the fact that daily bathing is an expectation of the job.  ""There are jobs where you bathe after work, rather than before, but this isn't one of them.  I need you to come to work having showered and wearing clean clothes."""
630,I would do so immediately.  If possible before the promotion is announced. I would let them know that while you desire the role you took this position at less pay because it would require less of a commitment.  Since the new role will have requirements of extra commitment I would expect a significant increase in salary. If you wait and do the work for a while at your current rate you actually lose leverage in negotiating a new rate.
631,"As has been mentioned, ideally your Human Resources department should be made aware of the situation and handle it. If it is in fact your responsibility, you need to address the issue directly, quickly and politely. Be upfront and request a private conversation with the individual. Ideally you should have a private office or otherwise a conference room/ect where you can close the door. You don't need to humiliate them, it's a private matter, keep it private. Be direct and tell them what is expected of them; their hygiene has to improve. Maybe they need to shower before they come to work, use deodorant, wash their hair thoroughly; you'll know the specifics. It's going to be uncomfortable so just make it as brief, clear and direct as you can. There is no ""nice"" way to say ""you stink"", but you can make it as painless as possible. Don't pull the ""A lot of people have been talking..."" garbage. You don't need to appeal to social proof in this situation, and you can make the employee feel alienated; like everyone's talking behind their back/out to get them/ect. It's not relevant or necessary and it feels like an attack. You're responsible, own up to the fact that it's you who's telling them they need to improve their hygiene. If they don't follow up on it, send them home. Again don't make a scene, contact them privately, but they have to go home, and you need to dock their time. Nothing is going to motivate them like lost time and money. If they don't shape up, make it clear their future employment is at stake if they can't operate professionally."
633,"It's not unthinkable that you will never get to fully see the effects of your work. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I was involved in building an industrial ERP. The project was far from a typical heavyweight ERP, it was a fully customized solution that dealt with everything, from accounting to precisely monitoring oil levels in a wide range of heavy machinery. We only called it ERP because we couldn't come up with a better description for it. Although it was a fairly boring project, since the solution covered almost every aspect of the client's operations, we had access to every data you can imagine, and then some. Whenever they introduced something new, be it new machinery, a new training program or even a couple of new faces, our little behemoth monitored everything and spat out performance reports by the kilo. Every little tweak in the system was immediately quantifiable, and each one of us had a pretty clear idea of whether our work was beneficial to the client or not. Fast forward a few years, and I'm working as a web developer for a small startup, that invests absolutely no time or resources in collecting such data, or trying to get feedback from clients. Sure, we had the typical automated analytics for all our web sites, but you can only make so much sense out of them. The company was more focused in getting new clients than keeping old ones, and management never saw any value in providing such feedback to us. Our only hope of getting even a vague idea of how beneficial our work had been, was the client calling us directly. Well, it happened. Once. At the end of the day the feedback you are looking for is information that should be passed from the client to your company, and then to you. Somewhere along the way the signal may get lost in the noise, especially if it was noisy to begin with. You should always feel free to ask your boss for feedback, especially since you are starting out, it's only natural to look for self fulfilment. But you should be prepared that you may never get it, ours is a creative craft that's extremely hard to quantify, even when the conditions are ideal. Every now and then someone mentions that they used a website I've build during casual conversation, and that's the closer I get to seeing the “real” accomplishments of my work. Unless of course something particularly nasty happens , then suddenly everyone seems to remember I was involved in the project, even if it's been almost a decade since I worked at the company that build the damn thing."
634,"I would discuss the money before accepting the position.  Accepting the position should be your decision. I would also spend some time examining your premise of ""it's a hole in my resume that at this point in my life I should really fill"". I would hope for reasons such as: Do you have a passion for the position?  Do you want to effect change?  Do you want to improve broken systems?  Do you want more pay?  Any and all of these can be valid reasons. Also, management and team lead positions do not have to mean huge hours.  That may be the culture, but there are always exceptions to the rule, and you can be one of them."
635,"Job listings such as these would test people psychologically, whether it's their intended purpose or not. At best it would attract people who may not know everything they ask for but have the drive and confidence to do so, and at worst it will bring people that would lie in their resume. If you make it in for an interview, congrats, you're already a step ahead and have given them the benefit of the doubt. Try to explain your work experience in more language-agnostic terms and actively attempt to draw in similarities with what you've used and what the job description is looking for. One of the best things you can do is teach them something interesting that they didn't know about, such as how your skills have solved a similar problem to what they might be facing."
636,"Arguably the simplest form of gamification would be a friendly contest. It could be anything, as long as it's work related, fun, and not too competitive. Fun rewards could range from silly t-shirts to books, nothing too pricey, you don't want people to get fixated on the price. The contest topic should be something related to the current goals of the company / team / project, whichever applies most, and it shouldn't be anything more serious than a friendly challenge. Whoever fixed the most bugs this week gets a silly t-shirt it's quite different than whoever comes last will be fired. Next you could have some kind of leaderboard, if your work has easily quantifiable aspects. To continue with the bug fixes examples, whoever fixes the most bugs each week gets a gold star, or any other silly achievement token you can think of, and every now and then the leader gets a price, bit more pricey than a book (two books?), or a couple of days off work. It would be impossible to come up with specific guidelines for gamification, as the process is entirely subjective (what's fun for me may not be fun for you), and quite dependent on the nature of your profession and the dynamics of your workplace. For example, there were gamification elements in every job I had, even in the strictest and most disciplined environment I had to face, the army. Getting a bit more recreation time than the rest of my company for disassembling and re-assembling my Heckler & Koch G3A4 in record time (don't ask, I don't remember) would be one example. And, of course, no answer on gamification would be complete without a mention to Stack Exchange. Chances are there is (or there will be) a Stack Exchange for your niche, and if you think about it, it's a ready made gamification platform for your company. Have your team mates compete by providing excellent answers or asking great questions, and use the existing reputation / badge mechanisms to quantify their contributions and reward them. If you are a manager, you can always spice things up a bit and ask questions on work related issues yourself, rewarding employees that would give you great answers. What you need to remember is that gamification is not about getting direct and immediate results, but mostly about having fun. Small and frequent rewards, preferably awarding the less illustrious aspects of the job (think: documentation), and always light hearted in nature, as the core concept behind gamification is encouragement and further engagement, not competition.

637,"Is the ""open doors"" policy for a project manager always beneficial?. I've heard that the ""open doors"" policy is beneficial, as it lets anyone come to the project manager with any problem that might arise. At the same time being interrupted at irregular times can be detrimental to productivity, as it takes everyone some time before they get back into the optimal mindset for work. This is why I'm wondering if it is always beneficial for a project manager to implement an ""open doors"" policy?"
639,"One of the primary responsibilities of a project manager is to help clear roadblocks and facilitate communications between stakeholders.  The last thing a project manager would want would be to not hear about a problem that needs attention until the weekly status meeting, for example."
640,"I think the key word here is ""promotion"".  If you are getting a promotion then I believe part of the promoting should be in the salary or package you get.  Companies in general will try to get as much out of you as possible for the least amount of remuneration as possible (of course that is a mass exaggeration but I don't think it's far off the mark) IMHO Promotion === Promotion in responsibilities + promotion in expectations === promotion in remuneration package It can be awkward bringing this up, so be sure to bring this up before accepting the role.  Once you accept, you are doing the work and so whatever value the company holds for that role you should be receiving in your pocket. Perhaps send an email to the boss along the lines of. Hi ..., I would like to discuss further the role of team leader role within
  the company.  Some of the topics I would like to go over include: What exactly does this role cover.  In what capacity will my    responsibilities increase. With this new role expectation is there any remuneration benefit to go with the extra responsibility and expectations.  If not immediate
  will there be any review along these lines in the future. I really enjoyed my work, life balance in my previous role.  Do you expect this to    be effected by a team leader position in regards to
  your expectations on how it    should be filled. Thanks and I look forward to talking with you some more on this great
  opportunity.... Or something along these lines."
641,"All management is essentially about managing people and the ""Open Door"" policy is one of most useful tools in the arsenal. There may be times when you are engrossed in something and don't want to be interrupted, in those cases, it's perfectly ok to just let it be known either via a sign or instructions. The person will understand and come back at a better time unless it's really urgent. At the end of the day, having an ""open door"" is more of an attitude then a process. If they use it, it means they trust that you care. If they know you are sincere when you say you have an open door, a ""busy, come back in 30 mins unless urgent"" sign doesn't change the effectiveness of the policy and you can still have small private moments if necessary."
642,"Why do companies list jobs on other sites but not on their own site?. Sometimes I run across jobs on Monster and other similar sites that look really good, and they're listed for companies that are good companies that I'm familiar with. However, when I go to the company website and look through their careers pages, the job doesn't seem to exist and isn't listed anywhere on their pages. Sometimes these jobs are posted just today, a day ago, or up to a couple weeks ago. It seems very strange that a company would list a job opportunity on a site like Monster but have no trace of that opportunity on their very own careers page. Is this a common practice, or should I be wary of listings such as these? What reasons would a company have to list a job opportunity this way?"
643,"Websites dedicated to job finding probably have a clear and easy way to input new job opportunities and get them displayed in manner of minutes. When it comes to company's private website, sometimes it can be wholly managed by a single webmaster without any special tools for any such tasks. In that case it can take awhile before the new information is inputted to the website, especially if the person is making it harder for some people."
644,"Yes, it happens, for a variety of reasons: The company web site doesn't support an easy way of posting and maintaining listings This may sound unrealistic but if you think about it, job listings websites are designed exactly for that purpose, and offer a far friendlier interface to post and more importantly keep track of and organize listings, and collect and archive resumes. Some countries may have specific regulations when it comes to collecting resumes, and it makes much more sense to make use of a job board that already follows them. In most company websites I've developed such facilities were not asked for, and when I proposed them, the common response was ""well, we are using careers site foo and we are happy with it"". The company web site doesn't really have that much traffic For companies that don't have much use of their web site other than simply having some sort of on-line presence, it makes much more sense to post their listings at a site where they'll be way more visible, especially from the job seeker's perspective. The company doesn't want to directly advertise they are hiring Several companies opt to post listings on job boards anonymously, and only reveal themselves at a later stage of the hiring process. Even if they do post under the company name, it's far less likely that their listings will be found by people who usually check their company web site, employees, clients and competitors. Now, one could argue that for the first couple of reasons it would make sense to post a listing in both a job board and the company web site. Well, that's really a question of cost, effort and value, in some instances it makes sense and in some it doesn't. If the job board provides an API or any other easy technical way of accessing your own data, the cost and effort are significantly smaller, as most of the process is automated. In conclusion, it's not unreasonable for companies to only post listings in job board sites and you shouldn't really worry about it."
645,"How can I politely decline a team lunch?. Most of the time, I find that lunch time is the one time that some bond occurs with between colleagues. There is a canteen onsite which we go to. We get to know a bit more about the person we are working with. However, about once a week, a group of them would go out to lunch to a local restaurant. I am reluctant to go along for a couple of reasons; financial and the choice of food at the restaurant. How can I politely decline without looking like a non-team player?"
646,"The best way is simply to be open and honest about why you don't want to go - this makes it clear that you are not making up excuses to hide something else. Nobody worth knowing is going to think less of you for not wanting to spend money on food you don't like. As long as they don't feel that you're trying to avoid the team, then they've no reason to take offence."
647,If your work-group has decided that it will have a regular weekly lunch and you choose not to participate you are missing an important part of your team's experience.  Often times at lunches business is discussed as well as strategies for dealing with issues that come up.  It is also an important time to network and build relationships with your coworkers. If the primary problem is financial then when you go order water and something light and inexpensive.  This is a sacrifice you make to integrate yourself with the team.  This investment in your team camaraderie usually pays for itself especially when it is once a week or less. At most restaurants there is some menu item that is tolerable to pretty much anyone.  If the problem is a religious dietary restriction or other person conviction issue then you can choose between conveying your issue with the team or making the decision to miss out on the opportunity.  Perhaps you could even suggest an acceptable location some time. In the end the event is optional.  Most teams I have been on do not feel that anyone is less a part of the team because they choose not to join for lunch.  But there is also no doubt that regular lunches build stronger relationships with your coworkers.  Even if you only join occasionally.
648,"What I find works, with employees just as with children, is right in the title of your question: expectations . There are people out there who, as you say, just don't get certain aspects of the workplace. Telling them explicitly what you expect from them can work wonders. I expect that you will get the work assigned to you done I expect that you will not interrupt high-priority work others are doing, to ask them to help you complete lower-priority work I expect that you will report problems and blockages to me before the all hands status meeting I expect that you will allow time every day to pause your own high priority work and help others who are having problems or issues I expect that you will update your work items yourself and not presume that verbal status updates in a meeting will cause others to update them for you Believe me, a person doesn't have to be a technical superstar to exhibit prima donna behaviours. It's just that they're the only ones who get away with it. When technically great people come and tell you they didn't get their pri 1 tasks done because a ""help vampire"" coworker bullied them into helping/doing-it-for-me with a set of pri 3 tasks, then the smug ""I got all my tasks done this week"" smile of said coworker doesn't last long. You can fire them, and your company will be fine. You can certainly discipline them without worrying you will lose them as a result. Things are different when it's your superstar. I know what it feels like to hold back when someone is clearly being wrong, because you think you need their skills. If you have big picture needs that are not being met, whether it's communication, ""overhead and paperwork"", supporting coworkers, supporting your process, whatever, a boss needs to set expectations with everyone that they have to do it. It may seem crazy to fire a good developer for not doing timesheets. But in some companies, it's crazy to bill less than you could, or to be unable to manage and estimate, because someone won't provide information the company needs. I come from a place of ""Chris doesn't realize these things are important here"" and so the first few times, it's private and it comes with an explanation. ""Chris, I want to bill [a client] today so the money will be here in time for payroll, and I have no idea how long you spent. Get me those numbers right away please."" If I'm always having to do that, then it becomes ""Chris, I'm billing next week and I don't want to have to ask you to drop everything and get me my numbers. Please catch up your timesheets today."" Eventually it becomes public, say at a status meeting ""and next week is billing, everyone up to date on timesheets? Really? Chris, yours were 2 weeks behind when I checked just before I came in here. Make it right this afternoon, please."" This reiterates your values to everyone and makes it clear where you stand on things. ""Chris"" will either start doing the damn timesheets like everyone else, or leave, or be fired. I don't threaten to fire people in status meetings, and I don't go to public shaming as step 1, but after a while this isn't about not knowing I care about timesheets (or work items, or documentation, or whatever else Chris is too good for), it's about not knowing I consider it a condition of employment. [Note: I chose Chris because it's a gender neutral name. But I just remembered I used to employ a Chris. He was no prima donna and not only didn't do the things I mention in this example, he didn't allow them from others either. Just in case anyone ever draws some kind of connection. Just needed a gender neutral name.] I have put up with crap in my time, partly from conflict avoidance and partly because ""the rest of his work is so good"" and I've come to realize that the impact on the rest of the firm of prima donna behaviour can outweigh the good they do. Either let everyone behave that way (maybe the timesheets are pointless after all), or get the prima donna in line."
649,"You've got clear, understandable reasons; tell them. Not everyone likes the same restaurant. If you're afraid you'll sound cheap by bringing up the financial aspect just say you don't like the food. Let them know you'd love to tag along if they try a different restaurant sometime to let them know you're interested in them, just not the food. You might even suggest a different better/cheaper restaurant if you have a good alternative. Often times once a habit has set in, groups just always go to the same restaurant, but if you suggest different people are willing to try something else. It's pretty common for people to decline these sort of things. And as long as you're eating with them on-site they'll get the hint that the restaurant is the problem, not them."
650,"How can frequent anxiety attacks affect me in business and the workplace?. I tend to get very stressed out about how things play out around me in the workplace.  A lot of the stress and anxiety comes from high level decisions and changes made by management and executives that are not necessarily detrimental to me but definitely change the workplace environment and expectations causing me to be consumed with inconsolable worry and anxiety. As I get older I have been sufferring more and more anxiety attacks.  We know the symptoms, feeling like I can't get a breath, heart pounding, cold sweats. Certainly my excessive worrying has helped me avoid bad situations in the past but more often than not my irrational worry and anxiety turns out to be unfounded, with little basis in logical fact (not that rational and logical thought really help; the fear is not rational). Fear is the mind-killer I feel like this hinders me severely in my career.  My coworkers and boss have taken notice and this stresses me out even more because now I am afraid they think me weak. My career aspirations are to make it into management someday because I am successful as a lead in turning around failing software projects and turning them into a success.  I love working with people and clients and love to coach and guide people.  I feel I would be a postive manager. My anxiety attacks are a manifestation of my stress, however will management think me too weak to take charge and be an effective leader? Am I too weak to be a good manager someday?  Perhaps I need to come to terms with my own shortcomings as it seems my other peers are much more easy going with chaos going on around them?"
651,"The best way to transfer knowledge is for the people who need the knowledge to work with those who have the knowledge. Whilst the knowledgeable people may not have the time to work on documenting their knowledge themselves, they may already be spending some of their time explaining to others what to do and how to do it. Even if the knowledgeable people had the time to write up their knowledge, it is not necessarily the case that the documentation they produced would be of use to the less knowledgeable people. It is surprisingly easy to miss out important ' obvious ' information when trying to impart knowledge. By making the knowledge transfer more explicit and co-operative, and having the users of that documentation write it so that they can understand it, you could both ease the burden on the knowledgeable people and get more information transferred. If the knowledgeable people are really pressed for time, you could ask the people who need that knowledge to write up what they understand now , and then have the knowledgeable people proof-read and correct any misunderstandings. This could substantially speed things up, and could also help identify areas where the knowledge is lacking. As an example of this, I work on scientific software. Neither I nor the facility scientists I work with could, alone, document much of the software I write. I could explain what my software does and even why it does it that way, but it's the facility scientists who need to write documentation on why and how visiting scientists should use it."
652,"It sounds like you may have an anxiety disorder .  You should consult with your doctor and perhaps a psychologist/psychiatrist about dealing with this.  It is unfortunately more and more common.  This is not something you did wrong or something you are at fault for.  But once you recognize it you are responsible for addressing it. Fortunately there are medicines that allow people with anxiety disorders to function at some approximation of normality.  There are also ways of dealing with them in a non-medical manner.  But all of these are best addressed by medical professionals , so I am going to leave that part of the answer to them. As for dealing with anxiety in the workplace, yes it can affect the perception of you in the eyes of others.  Those who do not understand what you are dealing with and do not recognize the symptoms are likely to resist working with you as you may be difficult to be rational with. I feel like this hinders me severely in my career. My coworkers and
  boss have taken notice and this stresses me out even more because now
  I am afraid they think me weak. Your coworkers are probably concerned for you.  The perception is probably not so much that you are weak as that you can be irrational or erratic.  This can be disconcerting to others who have to deal with you.  Part of the workplace is the social aspect.  In most positions your career is advanced not just by your ability to perform tasks but by your ability to work with a team.  If you refuse to address your anxiety it likely will impact your ability to progress in your career. Am I too weak to be a good manager someday? Perhaps I need to come to
  terms with my own shortcomings as it seems my other peers are much
  more easy going with chaos going on around them? I have known quite a few people who also have anxiety disorders that though therapy and medicine have led quite productive lives.  You recognize that you have a problem and that is an important part of any treatment.  Now you must decide how you want to deal with that problem."
653,"As others have said, psychological (""shrinks"") or psychiatric (""shrinks with pills"") treatment can help lessen the severity of your symptoms and make it possible for you to work more productively and with fewer symptoms. It is also an issue you should bring up with HR and your immediate supervisor if you feel comfortable doing so: ""I occasionally have panic attacks, if this happens insert best thing to do here "" Also note that at least in the United States a recognized psychiatric condition (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, etc.) can be grounds for ""reasonable accommodations"" under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Other jurisdictions may view psychiatric conditions as medical issues/disabilities and have similar protections. Regarding being ""too weak"" to be a good manager, I don't think psychiatric conditions are a sign of ""weakness"" - That's a pretty ancient mindset and I think it's generally recognized that they are a medical condition that can be treated effectively. I would note however that management positions quite often add stress (you're now responsible for the deadlines if they're missed, you may have to deal with team conflicts, or telling other departments to get bent) and if your personality is not one that can handle that, particularly if it triggers your anxiety, management may not be a role you want to take on. That is also something you can re-evaluate on an ongoing basis: If in a year you feel you can handle the extra work, responsibility and stress by all means pursue it, but always remember that your health (physical and mental) is far more important than career advancement."
654,"Besides depending on company culture, the answer certainly depends on your personality: If you often come late to work (measured against your normal time), there has to be a reason for it, and I would guess that this reason would make it difficult to make up for the lost time by getting in earlier some other day. Based on this assumption, it would probably be easier to just add the hours in the evening when you were late."
655,"I am a bit of a snob when it comes to food, but my experiences in my career have shown that the benefits of going to team lunches far outweighs the downsides. Avoiding the group lunches means that you will end up outside of the team, and I've never figured out how to counter that effect."
657,"Is there an effective way of dealing with nepotism at work?. The cardinal-nephew problem is quite common in Greece, where most businesses are (or started out as) family run.  Even in larger corporate entities favouritism to relatives and friends is not uncommon. One specific instance of nepotism I had to deal with in a previous job was with the boss' wife that was responsible for HR. She is lovely, but she lacked common technical skills, to the point that every once in a while I had to re-train her on how to use our internal CRM. Soon it became apparent that it was much less time consuming if she just asked me every time she needed something and I just did the work for her. A particularly annoying, but effective workflow. A couple of times I hinted that we needed to hire a tech savvy secretary to help her out, but nothing came out of it (and I never got a satisfying response as to why). Given that the practice usually stems from higher up in the company's hierarchy, there's little, if anything, an employee can do. To me it felt like an impossible situation and removing the option of moving on to another company, the only thing I could do is shut up and deal with it. Are there any other options to deal with nepotism in the workplace?"
658,"Of course it's acceptable to decline, but be prepared to accept the consequences of your actions that this may occur. Such as missing out on team bonding mising out on discussions of work activities not being around to make some decisions on a topic not being around when a new idea arises (some of the best ideas start
over a lunch or cold beer) not being in the loop of office politics not being aware in general of what's happening in the office and to me one of the most important, not getting to know your
colleagues a bit better outside the office environment"
659,"It's vital to be a team player, but being a team player doesn't mean you have to roll over for everyone. Being a part of team lunches once in a while shows that you have the professional courtesy to be a part of the group, but that you recognize that you have your own priorities as well. If you always take part, you run the risk of becoming entangled in groupthink. If you never take part, you run the risk of being alienated from the group entirely. Part of being a professional is knowing both how to lead and how to follow. Even the best managers have to listen to their subordinates, and team lunches are a great way to hear and be heard. Make the most of your time with them, and respectfully bow out when you can't do it. Staying removed but accessible gives you the ability to contradict ideas discussed at lunch if you feel they're a poor decision, as well as keeps you connected with your coworkers' lines of thinking. Most of all, it's important to be honest: tell your team, ""Sorry guys, but I'm on a budget."" They don't have to know that the chili gave you intestinal distress or that you thought you saw the fish filets moving; being conscious of your own responsibilities is excuse enough."
660,"A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon. – Napoleon Bonaparte The good news is that you're doing well in your new job and they're trusting you to handle more. The bad news is that you're not getting a promotion. Managers know what Napoleon knew – a little recognition will go a long way. In 99% of cases, the employee says, ""Hey! Great! I'm getting a promotion! Super!"" and goes off to celebrate. When you're told you're doing great and going to get a promotion, ask what the pay is! There's nothing wrong with this; it shows intelligence and aptitude. If you don't ask, you're not going to get a pay increase. The job title is the ribbon – it's shiny, it implies respect and management, and it costs the company nothing. As a matter of fact, in many cases, it's a cost-cutting measure to give these lateral-promotions to employees since the overtime they were paying now becomes required time under your salary (and if you're not, you soon will be with the added supervisory capacity). Now, not only do you not get paid overtime, it's in your best interests to get the job done without accruing overtime for your team. Here's the carrot and the stick – do it, and they may give you a bonus (which, by the way, if you're managing others you should always suggest); don't do it and you're the one who'll take the fall. Right now, you're working 1.5x the hours and not receiving any more pay for it. If they're not going to pay you more, leverage the job title lateral-promotion to find a new job."
661,"I do this commonly and I am upfront about the decision I make. Don't lie! I typically state: ""Sorry guys, going out right now does not fit into our family budget. But thank you for inviting me, and maybe in a few weeks I will plan to join you!"" If I do not care for the food, I just tell them like: ""Oh you are going for Mexican? I am not in the mood for that right now, but I will join you if you decide to go somewhere else!"" If they want you to join they will typically be flexible and say: ""No problem, where would you like to go?"" In the end if they are good team members you will not be judged for having a tight budget (especially if everyone knows the employer pay is sub-par!) or if you don't like a certain type of food."
662,"How can I ask my interviewers for feedback following an interview?. Recently, I had an interview with Amazon. At first, things went smoothly and well. After two interviews, they decided not to move forward with the process. I'm the type of person who wants to consistently improve, so I wanted to get some feedback regarding why they decided not to continue the process. I sent polite emails to the project manager and human resources to try to determine what I was missing. So far, I haven't received any responses back and it's rather frustrating not knowing why I wasn't qualified for the position. What else should I do to follow up and ask for feedback?"
663,"You can't force people to give you feedback. From what you say, you have already contacted them by email - this is about the limit of what you can do. It is entirely possibly that the reason for declining is something the interviewers are embarrassed about (or can't talk about). Some companies have a policy of not divulging the reasons for fear of legal consequences."
664,"The simple fact is that most interviewers won't provide feedback.  There are two major reasons, and the first is time.  When I interview, for example, I usually end up looking at somewhere between ten and thirty resumes, and spending around six or eight hours minimum on direct interviewing - per position. What I don't have is any extra time in the day.  So, spending half an hour or more writing up feedback for each unsuccessful candidate is hard to find time for, even if I want to. The second factor is that, while you want to improve, there are a whole bunch of folks out there who suck.  Folks who respond to feedback with some variant of "" ** you, you * ing * **"", or who use it to argue about how you unfairly missed their skills, or any number of other terrible ways to handle that feedback. That doesn't encourage people to respond - even to folks like you who really, genuinely do want to improve, and who will take it well. Actually, there is also a third possible cause: I often don't know about the hire/pass decision because I just file feedback in the system, and the decision is made by the hiring manager elsewhere."
665,"Nepotism isn't necessarily the issue here. The problem is you are doing the work of a less-qualified employee. The fact that she is the wife of your boss just makes the situation more sensitive. You really need to focus on the cost of this practice to the business rather than on the individual(s) involved. From now on, I suggest that you make a log of exactly when, with what, and for how long you spend time helping her. After you have collected some data (say a few weeks worth), you can then present the case to your boss. Detail why doing work you are over-qualified for is reducing your potential and suggest a solution (hire a tech savvy secretary)."
666,"The impact of going to regular outings with co-workers greatly depends on your potential influence in the company and where'd you want to go. The size of your company also matters a lot. In small businesses where the place is tightly knit and everyone knows each other, you would feel more pressure to participate. Here is when being part of a team is even more essential, and when the place is still small enough to do easy planning for get-togethers. We used to go almost daily, as a lot is talked about on how to grow the business and how to win the next client. Then I've been at the other end where I was at a larger company (~200 people) and the only people I stay in direct contact with are the developer team. My role was less significant to the whole operation and usually we had interns and juniors pass on our bi-monthly lunches with no problem. So far you haven't said that you want to decline lunch for reasons related to your co-workers, so I'm assuming that you don't have any conflicts within your team. If your cohesion with the team doesn't sound at risk, go ahead and say you don't want to participate. However the better alternative is to suggest an alternative restaurant to go to another week, to show that you have interest in going with them."
667,"You didn't specify how long you have been waiting for a response. Honestly, responding to your email is probably a low priority - they still have positions to fill, and people working in project management and recruitment positions tend to be extremely busy. I would wait at least a week, perhaps two before I expected a response. Something else to keep in mind is that some companies have policies to not discuss the results of interviews. I believe Microsoft is an example of this - you find out the results, but regardless of the outcome, they will not tell you what factors led to that result. Amazon might be this way as well. I would suspect that they would inform you if this was the case rather than being silent, though."
670,"About the best thing you can do is what you're doing: Ask (politely, once or maybe twice when you thank them for the opportunity to interview). As others have said there's no way to force them to provide feedback, but if you ask (""I understand you chose not to consider me for the position, If you have the time to discuss it may I know why so I can improve in the future?"") there are interviewers and recruiters out there who will be straightforward with you and tell you where they feel you came up short. (I'm one of them: If I don't hire someone I tell them why.) Unfortunately there are a bunch of reasons people may not provide feedback: They could be genuinely too busy, they could be denying you employment based on a protected status (yeah, it happens), or they might only be one voice in the hiring process and legitimately not know why you were blackballed. If you have a team/peer interview it may help to contact some of the employees who talked with you, but I'm hesitant to suggest this as a general case rule - it depends on the person and the company, and I'd only consider that if you have some other connection to the person (both car nuts, for example) - coming off as creepy stalker would be a Bad Thing for future employment prospects."
671,"I wonder how sustainable that kind of work/home integration is in the long run? The difficult part of this is we don't know what you're doing now . From the sounds of things, you're making use of flexible hours to deal with ""Home"", which is an extremely poor decision long-term. It seems easy right now to say, ""Well, I have to run the kids to soccer practice at this time, and I really should make a dentist appointment for that time..."" Ask yourself honestly: How long until this becomes, ""Eh, I'll do it after Jerry Springer.""? The most common thread I've found with employees who begin working from home is that they are completely incapable of sustaining their focus without serious division between work and family . That is, in order to work effectively from home, you (and your family) need to agree to: A set schedule of hours (""I am in the office from 8am to 12pm, 1 hour for lunch, and back in the office from 1 until 5"") A private area that is work only (""The home office is my home office during business hours. I'm not to be disturbed."") A direct line of communication back to the office (""I'll call and check in with my supervisor at 4:30pm before knocking off for the day."") The more you treat working from home the way you'd work from the office, the more successful and sustainable telecommuting becomes. Is a hard separation of work and home required to do a good job AND look like you are doing a good job? This is all about keeping in contact. If you're working out of the office only 1 day a week, then it may be less important, but make sure there's a paper trail. If you're visiting clients, make an excuse to call into the office to check in, perhaps claiming that you need a bit of information from a file that you forgot to grab. If you're working from home, checking in at the end of the day with the supervisor can help give you a better view of how they perceive your work ethic and help you shape that perception. Remember, you're working from 8 am to 5 pm – make those your set hours and make yourself available in them. You absolutely, positively must separate work and home. No one can effectively juggle both without serious detriment to one or the other."
672,"I recently had a phone interview with Amazon.  I thought it went well, but they called back and said I wasn't a fit for the role.  I asked for feedback, and was specifically told by the recruiter that she ""cannot provide specific feedback"".  It might be a company policy."
674,Questions on drinking alcohol in a work-related context.
675,"I second Chad in the sentiment that your co-workers are likely concerned about you rather than at all disgusted by you. I have a couple of disorders recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act and it has always, always been the case that when I'm freaking out about my performance or attitude or whatever, my co-workers and boss were worried about my health and not my productivity or ability to do my job. So this is my advice: Go to a psychiatrist not for treatment, but for diagnosis. If ( if! ) you actually have an anxiety disorder, you are afforded some protections under the ADA. Unfortunately, you can't get them without an official diagnosis. If your health insurance doesn't cover such things, look to your local universities with psych programs to get a diagnostic appointment on the (relatively) cheap. Search through some anxiety forums for book recommendations; there are many that deal specifically with stress in the workplace (I haven't read any, so I can't recommend them personally). Believe it or not, LiveJournal is actually a really good place for mental health communities. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but have an honest discussion with your boss . You don't necessarily need to ""out"" yourself to all of your coworkers, but good managers will want to help you succeed. Assuming you have a good manager, just having this talk will probably ease a lot of your anxiety, because you won't be so concerned about negative impressions. Having stress and anxiety does not make you weak--on the contrary, acknowledging them and looking for solutions makes you stronger. As long as you're willing to address the problem, there is absolutely no reason you can't advance in your career. It's also worth noting that if, as you say, much of your anxiety has to do with decisions made by higher-ups, being the one making those decisions might in itself be a great relief for you."
677,Questions about the ability to get work done in an efficient manner
679,Questions about the interactions of employees in a group
681,"References is a section in résumé or otherwise organized list of people an applicant has been working with, and who may provide with a feedback on their working with the applicant"
682,"Does the employer let you leave the premise during lunch ? If so then it shouldn't make any difference when and what you do during your lunch. If you can leave and play video games offsite, then you should be able to sit at our desk/break area and do the same thing. I don't think you should need to leave work just to enjoy your break. If your company feels they need to control everything you do during a break, then maybe it's time to find a different workplace."
684,"I generally just directly ask the person I'm going to be interviewing with, or the person setting up the interview (who is sometimes, but not always, the same person).  I don't see much point in trying to guess or find out indirectly. You asked for exact language, but I don't think it matters much.  In one case, I asked (by e-mail) ""What should I wear (suit and tie, casual)?""  In another case, I was a bit more informal because I was asking a friend who works there: ""I'm guessing (and hoping) that this is casual dress (I had to wear a full suit and tie for an interview today).""  (In both cases, the answer was business casual.) There's enough uncertainty about proper clothing for technical interviews that coming out and asking shouldn't make a bad impression. Once or twice I've worn a suit and tie to an interview and been asked why I was dressed so formally; in one case the person interviewing me said he didn't own a suit himself. EDIT : If there's a good reason not to just ask the interviewer what to wear, I'd be interested in seeing it."
685,"While you could ask, another way to resolve this is to go do a little reconnaissance of gathering the information by watching the place when people show up for work there assuming it isn't a massive place where it may be hard to figure out who are the developers in that place. If I did have to ask someone at the place, I'd likely phrase it, ""Hi, I'm coming in for an interview and wondered if there was a dress code I am to follow."" The key in using that kind of wording is that I'm just asking the question in a direct manner without a lot of fluff or build up.  If necessary I would disclose my name and the interview details but I don't see these as important initially to note."
686,"If you talk to the people that use the software you produce, I'd likely ask them for the details of the story for what kind of impact has some of the changes you've done brought them.  I'd bypass the manager as the key here is to know what are the important bits of the story.  For example, I could imagine getting someone to tell me, ""That program you gave me makes this take only a few minutes where it used to be hours before!"" or ""Wow, I love being able to see the inventory now.  Very powerful stuff there,"" kind of lines that really do pump me up quite a bit though if the information is secondhand or third hand then it is likely to not quite be as powerful or authentic to my mind. While metrics can be nice as a bullet point, giving the emotional punch of the story where someone can suddenly feel way more empowered to do great work may sell a bit better in some circles."
687,"6 Sigma - What it Means 6 Sigma is commonly used as a measure of quality striving for near perfection. Originally, it was used in manufacturing as a quality control objective of reducing the end variation of process output such that the customer experience would result in no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. The term of 6 Sigma derives from the 6 standard deviations (represented by ""σ"") strived for between the mean and the closest standard limit. On the graphic below, a shifted 6 Sigma (4.5 Sigma with 6 Sigma's arbitrary 1.5 Sigma Shift) plot is illustrated rather poorly in green. This is compared to a normal distribution (a 3 Sigma process), illustrated rather worse in red. 6 Sigma proposes the use of a specific set of quality management tools, statistical methods, and specifically qualified managers to implement projects with quantified financial targets and well defined milestones. All of this is a rather long-winded way of saying this: ""By decreasing process variation, you decrease cost and increase customer satisfaction."" It should be noted that 6 Sigma is a buzzword and is nothing significantly different than most versions of quality improvement. It has become exceptionally well marketed by consultants and certification organizations, as well as the success of larger companies using this particular form of quality improvement. For What It's Used For the most part, 6 Sigma has its roots well and truly entrenched in manufacturing, though other sectors have begun extrapolating its processes into their own lines. Ultimately, the goal is about standardization of processes to increase quality. It has been employed successfully in large corporations, healthcare organizations, and manufacturing as a means of reducing costs and increasing client satisfaction. Changing the Way You Work Potentially, application of a 6 Sigma process to your workplace could very well change the way you personally work. The rigid structure offered by the process can reduce the overall variation of your job to either increase profits or decrease costs, though it can also lead to decreased adaptability. More often than not, the end result is that a consultant or consultants come in and insert themselves in the process to lead the direction the company takes in response to its goals. It's quite common to then watch these companies underperform in relation to the market ."
688,"Because I'm not remotely a mental health professional, I'm going to focus purely on the Workplace-related questions. Please don't for a second think I am ignoring or do not respect very real mental health concerns. That being said, with the exception of your confident statement in the middle, you just described almost every good software developer I've ever worked with, for, or managed ! (And a few bad ones, too.) I'm going to address some of your statements individually: Decisions made at managerial levels above you are causing you to be consumed with worry and anxiety. -- How are these decisions being
communicated with you and your peers?  If your managers are dictating
from on high, and they are not welcoming input or discussion, I'd be
stressed out, too, especially if I am a developer who can see the big
picture, who interfaces with clients, and who has a desire for
positive outcomes for everyone.  In other words, you care.  This is
good.  Tipping over into all-consuming worry? Not so good, but sometimes
not entirely your fault -- if I, as a manager, didn't constantly
communicate with and not to my employees, I'd expect to face a
stressed-out bunch.  So, stop for a minute and think: are you
worrying because something is unknown because your manager is a bad
communicator ? Don't own that worry, if that's the case.  Confront it
and make the manager be better (you said you like to coach, yes?) Your boss and coworkers have noticed and might think you're weak, which makes you feel worse. -- Is this a perception, or have your
boss and coworkers actually come up to you and said ""suck it up,
weakling!""  If your boss hasn't, and this is a perception, go talk to
him or her immediately and get the facts out in the open. You can
only work positively with facts. You confidently stated the things you are good at (turning around
failing projects, coaching and guiding people) -- weaklings don't do
that. Actual weaklings, and people who have little to no utility as
leaders, tend not to find any positive factors about themselves or
their work.  You give yourself the credit you are due (and, to
localize this answer for a moment, given the questions and answers
and engagement you show on Programmers.SE, you absolutely should give
yourself this credit).  This is a good thing. It is clearly done
without arrogance, and with confidence, which is an even better
thing. You think you have shortcomings -- Yep. You probably do, just
like we all do. Dwell not on those, but on all the positive things
you know are true. Work on your shortcomings, here, with a coach,
whatever the case may be -- just like you like to coach others, let
someone else coach you. It's why they (and mentors, and good people
on SE) exist: because we all have shortcomings and we all
consistently work at getting better. You worry about irrelevance -- I find this one amusing, because
in my experience, managers are the first to go .  I've been through
all the booms & busts, and it's not the developers who get tossed
aside first. And it's not the out-of-work managers who can name their
price in the next job: it's solid, thoughtful, productive developers.
Usually the ones who worry too much, too.  The ones who care. Like others have answered, have a discussion with your boss , especially if communication is poor, and especially if you have a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder of any sort. If you have not had any official, negative performance evaluations, then your conversation can go something like ""You see my productivity and value to the company and my peers? Well, I'm stressed out to the max because of X, Y, Z.  Can we work together to mitigate that stress in some way?""  Managers worth their salt will have been trained or at least had discussions with HR folks to address these concerns. A blocker that is all stress is no different in its need to be cleared than a blocker that is technical in nature.  Your manager should work with you to clear blockers.  If you have had official, negative performance evaluations, then your manager should be working with you on a performance management plan that will enable you to succeed , not punish you for having the brain that you do. Either way, that conversation is not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of maturity."
689,"Value of working onsite versus remotely in a programming internship. I received an offer for a summer internship that's on the other side of the country from my university.  I have the option of working remotely, and since I'm having trouble finding someone to sublet my apartment, I'm heavily considering it.  It makes more sense fiscally to stay here, as I'd have to deeply discount my rent for someone to sublet. I've never had the experience of working in a professional environment as a programmer--I've only done personal development work, worked in a research group, and done a little contracted development that was self-directed.  I understand there are lots of advantages to a physical presence, especially in an internship environment. I'm not looking for a subjective suggestion of what to do, especially since I'm the only one who knows every detail of my specific situation (and since that's not a SE-friendly question). What specific experience or knowledge can I gain from being present that I would likely miss out on by working remotely, specifically in a programming internship?"
690,You'll miss out on some of the bonding that tends to happen with the chatter of being in an office.  This includes the simple things like going to lunch together or asking various personal questions that isn't likely to have equivalent answers given via IM or e-mail.  Forming the network of connections and really getting what makes someone tick can require watching facial expressions and mannerisms that if you are working remotely you probably won't get to see.  Mentoring would be another way to see some of this as it isn't likely that a code review or a few other big technical things can be done easily if people are miles apart.
691,"It's difficult to obtain proper feedback. I think that many firms have maturing HR policies and are advised against providing specific feedback. Also, don't assume that a rejection is a critique of your skills. I've been passed-over for positions for cultural-fit reasons... Sometimes, it's the approval of an entire team, and there's a holdout. My best advice is to try to establish rapport with the person guiding the application/interview process. Make sure you obtain business cards/contact for each person you meet with. Before you walk out of an interview, be certain to ask about the decision timeline and what the ""next step in the process will be"". If they do not move forward in the process, use the main HR contact as your first line. Email is best. If you made a particular connection with an interviewer, you can try. But know that it's rare to receive solid feedback these days."
692,"You didn't mention in your question whether your application was directly to Amazon or via a recruiter/agent. I'm assuming the former, in which case the answers you have received are excellent - you've asked, there are reasons they might prefer not to answer, not much more you can do. But if you did go through a recruiter, it's worth prodding them once or twice more. Firstly, because they have an incentive to help you out on this. A company that has decided not to hire you has no reason to help you with your future jobhunting. But a recruiter needs to get you hired to get his cut. And secondly, because a recruiter may well have an ongoing relationship with the company and be much more able to get an answer out of them than Joe Random-Jobseeker could."
693,"In a first internship I think that most of what you learn is to work in real work environment, in real programming teams, with real-world demands. All this can't be really experienced remotely. The communication with your team-mates, meetings, presentations, pair programming, code reviews, brainstorming, the sense of a team is mostly lost... A lot of times you will want to ask or explain things that through any informatic tool you can't or is a lot harder. Technically you will get better too, but this can also be done reading books and/or contributing to big open-source projects...the work environment will only exist AT work... IMHO I think that a lot more can be learned if you are present."
694,"It is nothing personal, it is just business. This is a phrase you'll hear in every day life in the corporate world. Everyone has different abilities to deal with stress - what is considered chaotic and stressful in some companies will be considered normal in others. It all depends on what the company environment is. The sort of stressful levels for people at some consulting companies (say, "" white shoe "" consulting companies like KPMG or McKinsey) will be too much for many people. Add to that the ""up or out"" mentality and some people would be reduced to tears in months. People who thrive in those environments ""die of boredom"" in less stressful environments. I tend to get very stressed out about how things play out around me in the workplace. A lot of the stress and anxiety comes from high level decisions and changes made by management and executives that are not necessarily detrimental to me but definitely change the workplace environment and expectations causing me to be consumed with inconsolable worry and anxiety. Based on this remark, I think it is driven by a feeling that you have no control, or things are out of control. This is similar to why people feel scared when flying and don't feel scared when driving; even though flying is safer, the lack of control makes passengers feel unsafe compared to when they are driving a car. Like the others, I'm going to recommend that you visit a therapist in order to determine what levels of stress are acceptable to yourself, and what levels are not. Learn where your boundaries are and if your current company is on the wrong side of those boundaries, one of you has to go: you, or the company. I've worked with people who have anxiety disorders. The most severe one was diagnosed with a really bad case of Aspergers. With medication and a few small changes to the environment (like letting him have an office with a closeable door, instead of setting him adrift in the sea of cubicles), he was able to function."
695,"You will almost never get such feedback in the US. Mostly because people are concerned about lawsuits, they'll never say ""it appeared to us that you were weak in area_Q"" because that invites an argument/discussion that no, you are fully qualified in area_Q. Likewise, if you rubbed them the wrong way, you won't get an accurate assessment of the issue."
696,"I have found the only option that produces results is: As at the end of the day - while you are physically there - ask, and be forward. i.e. be forward not as in 'be pushy' but be forward in asking several questions to try and elicit an answer.  Focus on being very polite at the same time and try to appeal to their better nature.  As always a little sugar helps... e.g. ""This looks like a great company and a really exciting position... any areas that you would say I am weak in based on what we've gone over?"" So this doesn't help with the Amazon position, but it's good advice for the future... You may initially hear a lot of ""well we have to discuss it more internally and blah, blah, blah"".  Don't be put off.  Push harder.  Say ""ok, were there any areas that you feel I was stronger in? weaker in?  Any areas of concerns?""  This is one of these situations where if you sit there long enough and ask enough times, they will eventually tell you something! Also be aware that interview may seem to go well because the people were really nice, however in today's tech market, if the interview(s) for the day don't end with some big signs like ""if we were interested what your salary range?' ""if we pursued this further, when could you start', etc.  If you're not hearing something like that in today's market best advice is to move on.  There's a very high probability they're not interested."
697,"Is it frowned upon to take unproductive breaks while on the job?. I've seen several people in there workplace, within their confined area in the office, who were working. I've also seen people who were supposed to be working, but were, instead, tweeting (or had the ""Twitter-Jitters"" if you will) or on Facebook or another social networking site. Is this frowned upon within the average workplace? Is it unprofessional? Do most companies/businesses have rules against this?"
698,"I don't think there is a single correct answer about it. Some workplaces have a very relaxed culture — you'll find people playing ping pong at 10am and 3pm. These same places are unlikely to judge someone too harshly for web-surfing, sitting on a couch, or chatting to a coworker, unless those activities are too frequent or get complaints. Generally, the perspective/attitude of these cultures is that a mind needs to have breaks in order to be productive at other times.  These cultures are often highly dependent on creativity.  As Don Draper said, ""You came here because we do this better than you and part of that is letting our creatives be unproductive until they are."" Some workplaces actively block distracting websites and set schedules for break rooms —  I've worked at places that took this approach, blocking youtube.com, facebook.com and stating that the ping pong table (at least until the ping pong table was taken away) was only to be used during lunch and after hours. These workplaces (meaning executives, managers, and even peers) are, in my opinion, very likely to judge people for ""unplanned"" breaks such as web surfing. There are likely to be workplaces in between these two extremes.  Again, there's no single answer — you'll have to assess the environment for yourself. In either case, you've got to get your work done, and/or at least avoid being found slacking/relaxing a majority of the time to be held in high regard as a motivated, productive worker."
699,"It is important for your mental health to take short ""breaks"" occasionally.  Most people tend to find it difficult to concentrate intensely on one thing for more than 20-30 minutes, so after a brief bout of ""deep thought"", it's actually good to shift your focus to something completely unrelated.  Even better is to stand up, stretch the legs, and walk about for a minute, which is also good for maintaining your physical health if you're stuck behind a desk all day. In a relaxed working environment this is easier to do.  If your boss is a real B* * *D and frowns on anything that keeps you healthy during your work hours, then this is something to either negotiate, or to do discretely. As long as you are getting your work done and meeting your obligations, taking occasional short breaks should not be a problem. However, if you are sitting around playing games, updating your blog and other stuff, then you are probably on very dodgy grounds ethically. If you are meant to be working, but instead simply taking time out to essentially screw around, then you'll end up with a poor performance review, and possibly being shown the door. The line between how unprofessional or not your behaviour is viewed will come down largely to company culture and your relationship with your boss, but will also depend on how you go about taking your breaks, and your reasoning why."
700,Should you always counter the first offer letter?. I just received the first offer letter and it is better than what I asked for. So I am tempted to just accept it but many people and sites say you should always counter. Is it always better to counter asking for more?
701,"My personal experience over the last 9 months has been through telecommuting 2 days per week, and I had similar thoughts to your question during my first couple of months. You do need to maintain a distance between your work and home life, and if you have a high degree of stress at work, you don't want that stress to permeate your home. My best advice is to look to the following: I can't stress enough how important it is to have a separate work area that you can close off from the rest of the house. A small room as a study/office with your workspace set up ergonomically, and preferably with a comfortable sofa. You need to be able to ensure that you can work undisturbed, even if you have to put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your study door. Closing the door allows you to create a demarcation line between your work and home lives.  If you can't arrange a room, then your next alternative is to ad some sort of a curtain, or a screen that you can use to a similar effect. If you need to return to your workspace after dinner or ""family time"", then use your screen/curtain/door to ensure your workplace is out of view while you are with your family. No TV, or other distractions near your workspace. Designate times when you can allow yourself to do other non-work related stuff like your laundry, or your errands, and then stick to your working times.  Sure, you can be flexible, but you should also be able to plan at the start of your day how your telecommute day schedule will work. Work in short bursts of 15-30 minutes, then take little breaks to stretch your legs, clear your head, and if you have the sofa I mentioned earlier, you can even stretch out on it occasionally, just to really give yourself a break when you are between ""shifts"". Work out your day schedule to include these ""shifts"" in order to ensure you allocate enough time to complete your work for the day. In my particular case, I allocate my usually daily travel time to cover the breaks and errands that I may need to cover during the day. Most importantly, try not to worry about how productive you are, or how your boss will perceive you. You don't need to feel stressed when in your home, and you will probably find yourself working more intensely while telecommuting regardless. Therefore relax, and enjoy the novelty of sitting around in your pyjamas while you work. This is all based on my own experience and has worked for me.  I found that I started to work most productively when I set myself clear goals, and when I stop worrying about perceptions and simply go ahead and get the work done. Even better, I can take a long lunch, sleep in, wake early for a jog, or whatever I wish to do during the day without feeling guilty that I haven't done my job when I know that my ""shifts"" are going to be intense and focussed.  Personally, I'd telecommute every day if I could convince my boss that I don't need to physically attend meetings."
702,You were offered more than you asked for.  At this point going back and countering asking for more still will appear greedy.  That is not to say you can not get more but you have an offer that will make you happy.  Why not take that good will and show them that doing right by you is going to pay off.  If you ask for more they could withdraw the offer all together.  So the question is would you rather have more than you asked for for sure.  Or take the risk that you might get more but might lose a great offer? For what it is worth I did consulting for nearly 20 years.  I only rarely ever countered.  I had an expectation.  If they offer came in below that I either accepted or rejected.  Sometimes they came back with more usually I would reject them anyway.  I have never had an offer come in for more than I asked for.  And I have some fairly good references.
703,It's a risk and I would say that what to do depends on: Your cash.  When is rent due. The company size.  At a small company it's more likely closer colleagues will know about it. How good the non-cash intangibles are. If you have any other offers. How confident you are about getting another offer quickly. The hours and if the pay implies 80 hours work for 40 hours pay?
704,"Don't be greedy. If it's more than you wanted anyway, just take it. You could risk it, but you may end up blowing the opportunity if they decide to revoke their offer altogether and offer it to someone else. The choice is yours. Choose wisely."
705,"There aren't any hard and fast rules about ""you MUST counter the first offer"" - If you have an offer you like, accept it. That said, these are the guidelines I've always used: If you asked for a number and they came back with a higher one - DON'T counter. They already value you higher than you valued yourself - you will appear to be greedy if you ask for even more.  If you really wanted more money you should have asked for more (when negotiating start with an unreasonable demand and work your way toward what you think they'll accept). If you asked for a number and they came back with that number - Don't counter. Or more accurately, be prepared to blow the deal if you do.  You named a number. They agreed. Trying to get more now will be seen as reneging on the deal (because it is: You're reneg otiating  after they already agreed to your demands). Again, if you really wanted more money you should have named a bigger number. If you asked for a number and they came back below it - Counter if you must. If the number you named was high and you have a cushion you can consider taking an offer below the number you named (as long as it meets your financial needs). Of course if you asked for $75,000 and they came back with $50,000 it may be a different story -- I don't usually build in a 33% cushion into my figures :-) If you didn't ask for a number but they came back with more than you expected - Maybe counter. You can probably get a little more out of them, most companies make an offer below the maximum they are willing to spend to bring you on board.  Conversely though if they tell you they can't do any better be prepared to accept (or walk away). If you didn't ask for a number and their offer is below what you are looking for - Think Carefully . Sure, you might get more money out of them, but if the number is REALLY low the company might also be struggling to make ends meet, or they may consider workers expendable cogs: When you get sick of the low pay, long hours and horrid working conditions you'll quit and they'll get another underpaid peon to do the job. Working in such an environment is a soul-sucking experience -- Avoid it if at all possible. I'm also a big proponent of ""Make me an offer based on what you think I'm worth"" rather than naming a number.  If I am forced to name a number I name a range, and I aim high, for the reasons I already mentioned above."
706,"Should I recommend a friend's brother for a job at the company I work at?. I started working three weeks ago as a web developer at a local company with around 100 employees. While drinking beer with my friend, he mentioned that his brother was looking for a job. I have never met the brother, who's a student.  I mentioned that the brother should apply at my company, and that I'd put in a good word if I got the chance. But I wonder if I opened my mouth too much here: while I'd love to help him get the job, I think my friend is expecting too much since I have never met his brother or know anything about him. He's asking if I could talk to the HR department directly and recommend the brother.  I told him that his brother should apply for the position himself and send a résumé over to me so I can talk about him if he makes the interview. Overall, did I make a mistake here? I don't know how to tell him to drop unrealistic expectations; I fear he thinks I am going to ""hook him up"" to a job. I am afraid if his brother turns out to be a slacker or horrible, it will reflect poorly on me. UPDATE: I got an email with his résumé and I've said if there's an opening I'll forward his resume to my boss and made it clear there's no guarantee. What I'm now concerned about is: what if he applies and claims that I am recommending him to the company? Would HR take it as if I am vouching for him even though I've never even let HR know yet? Is this an excessive worry? I can say that I will never do something stupid like this again. It's time consuming for all parties and I am going to keep my mouth shut about work while drinking."
707,"You are correct that you don't want to vouch for someone that might not be qualified. So what I would do is talk to the brother and give a ""pre-interview"" to him.  If he's lacking in certain qualifications, I would advise him and tell him to work on those things beforehand.
As for work ethic/attitude (""slacker""/""horrible""), you can't really find that out until he starts working there (unless you found that out somehow during the ""pre-interview""). If you've done your homework and he seems okay, you're ""off the hook"".  If they interview him and he flops, you would tell them that you talked to him and thought he was okay.  If they hire him and he flops, that means he got past you and the HR of your company, so there was no way to predict his performance. If your recommendations keep flopping, I would be very careful in making future recommendations."
708,"You cannot get anything more from Amazon.  There is no benefit to Amazon in continuing to correspond with you.  But I have also interviewed at Amazon, and have done a lot of interviewing myself, and can tell you what happens on the other side of the table. At companies like Amazon, candidates are rarely rejected for lack of some specific technical knowledge.  This means that no one will tell you something like ""If you had more knowledge about SQL, you would have been hired.""  If that was the only problem, you would have been hired, and it would be assumed that you would learn SQL as needed. Usually the hiring decision is made in a meeting of all the interviewers, including the hiring manager.  It takes nearly unanimous agreement to hire. Here are some reasons candidates I have interviewed (at other ISVs, not Amazon) have been rejected: Unreasonable self-assessment.  Candidates who claim to be expert or near-expert but are intermediate at best. Unable to discuss items on the resume in detail.  If you don't know much, don't list it.  One of the interviewers will know, and will ask you about it. Unable to demonstrate a grasp of fundamental data structures and algorithms.  Some companies may not care.  Amazon is not one of them. Difficulty solving programming problems that the hiring team considers to be fairly simple.  When a candidate struggles with a problem, the interviewer won't say ""sorry, we are looking for the people who solve this in under five minutes.""  Maybe they should, but they don't. In my experience, at top companies the interviewers usually start with an ""easy"" question, and expect something close to a solution in about ten minutes. No evident interest in the field; haven't read anything since graduation; no opinion on languages or technologies they have used. I don't know if Amazon rejected you for any of the above reasons, but hopefully this will give you some more insight into the interviewing process."
709,"Usually when i recommend someone for a job i make sure i know that person a bit. I've recommended friends and friends of friends, but i`ve always had a background on what they can do and how they are as people. So in your case you might have been a bit fast in offering that proposal. Nevertheless he might prove as an asset to your company and to you. P.S. Why not try and have a chat with his brother and see where he stands? Maybe that will make it more easy in taking a decision on your dilemma."
710,"Generally I think referring or recommending someone for a position is a risky business.  Essentially you are putting your reputation on the line in that how they perform may reflect on you.  I would suggest never recommending or backing someone unless you were confident in their abilities and had a complete grasp of their work ethic.  If you believe you have this then by all means put in a word in the right ear.  I think in this day and age I would consider recommendations from existing employees (especially if I value their contributions) go a long way to selecting a condidate for a position. I think you have done well to say send in your CV, but perhaps make it clear that you are not reponsible for the actual hiring process etc  Perhaps say the HR have some fairly strict processes everyone needs to follow but you could have a talk with the brother and give him some pointers.  It might also give you a chance to sound him out! If he is a slacker and you have referred him then yes, I would imagine it will reflect badly on you in some context. FYI.  I once recommended and got a good friend a position.  I knew he was a hard worker and he ended up being an excellent worker.  He in turn got another friend a job but that guy ended up being a bit of a slacker.  He said to me that he regretted recommending him as he felt it reflected badly on him and other co-workers talked about him all the time how bad he was.  It put him in an awkward situation both in the workplace and in the social scene with this friend. Although your situation is a brother of a friend it too might put your friendship in a potentially strained situation if things don't turn out.  Just be prepared for that and try and maintain a work / friendship seperation if you can with your friend."
711,"In my last interview they asked, as they always do, if I have any further questions. I replied: ""Yes. Can you tell me how you felt this interview went?"" And I got an honest (and positive) reply. I was offered the job and I accepted. (I used ""felt"" instead of ""thought"", because I thought that will be lower threshold to answer.)"
712,"Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to
  keep your mouth shut. Ernest Hemingway We have all said something over a few beers that we later regret. That probably includes your friend, he probably wont hold you to it. Probably the best approach is just to be honest. Offer to give his resume to HR directly (this does get him a foot in the door at least) but be clear that you cant recommend him as you don't know him well enough."
713,"Recommendation of a potential candidate is always a better ""bet"" than just getting one through any other methods. However, as you have only be with the company for 3 weeks, your recommendation may not be authoritative enough. I would make it clear to your friend that his brother would still have to submit his CV to the appropriate people and to prove himself at the interviews. This ensures that the real legwork is still to be done by his brother. I would make it clear to your friend what my influence are on getting his brother a job at the company, and how limited it is. Basically, just forwarding his CV and perhaps a quick introduction. It could strained your friendship, but if your friend is close, she will be able to understand your situation and the position that you are in."
714,"In my experience of over a decade in the industry i still find that getting real feedback is still not a regular thing. There are multiple things at play here. But there are things you can do. 1. Onus is on you tell me that getting explicit feedback is more of trying to find yourself and figure out based on action rather than people coming back to you with explicit good/bad (let alone quantitative) and from that, figuring out what was due to your contribution is probably even harder. But as a general rule in one's career, the onus to get feedback is on us then on the customer or management might be coming down. 2. The good/bad balance Good feedback comes very less. Bad ones almost always. How often have you had tasted a great new dish in the restaurant and rush to the kitchen to appriciate the chef? Against this, how often you had a service complain and yelled back to the call center? You will realize, that typical customers are like Unix commands; when everything is fine usually there is no feedback. When things go wrong you will see a surprise bomb on a Good Monday morning. So in a way, when explicit feedback hasn't come to you, you can actually be a bit relaxed that you never did a big enough goof up that someone will bother you with. 3. Your level in hierarchy matters Not getting feedback also sometimes means that your higher ups have taken up responsibility of it. In that case, talking to higher up or having open communication repo helps. When you will move up the ladder - most errors will be owned by you and you will see more direct view of it. Many comapanies, don't count lower hierarchy people share feedback thinking that it will unnecessarily move them. 4. Transparency is what changes signal to noise ratio Many organizations has fat layers across which one cannot see. There is clear hierarchy laid out for responsibility laid out. But things needs to travel only on pre-defined paths. So good or bad, if you are not higher up in the ladder or relevant function of company - you don't need feedback and you don't get feedback. Most often asking customers or sales guys directly might be best best -but it could be a bad gesture or a complete taboo in many organisations. Actually, in a startup like companies you can always openly discuss the matters. But that also depends on your initiative to ask more relevant people. In all regards, it is the habit to ask (harmlessly) will give you some feedback. 5. Quantification needs systems In many companies, systems are inherently geared up on processes and quantification. When your core processes or systems are more tacit by nature it is difficult, costly and sometimes quite artificial to generate this information from this. As Yannis pointed out, when there are no measurements in the system to start with, asking for quantified measure might be pointless; but if your organization is open in communication, seeking explicit feedback is more of the tacit form and you can seek that from people who you trust. 
What is important is to get to know first what was the overall fate of the project? What elements were good or gave problems, and did we do well for time and budgets. This are sometimes easy to answer but difficult to measure. 6. Feedback against expectations Sometimes what we really care about is how much of our work is aligned to the purpose of the larger objective or not. It is different from knowing whether we are doing a good job or not. I know of cases where a young guy works out of his way and what he thinks a homerun, ideally should have been done much more systematically by more or senior people. The point is, there is a difference between (self) appraisal [how well you could do against your caliber] and end user feed back [whether customer had any help from this work]. Both this things match only when your profile is perfect fit against customer expectations on your job. This looks obvious, but rarely true in real life. 7. Understand the bigger picture Quite often, people take things granted when they see things obvious. You will see many peculiar departments don't receive value because they don't participate (or are not allowed to participate) strategically. Admin guys, IT guys, even HR guys sometimes stand by the wayside and people keep watching the finance and sales guys taking up the center stage. It is not that company will not work without them, but it is not the core business of the company. In my opinion great many people should outsource stuff - but that is not always true. The same function could be very valuable in other companies. So if you part of that dock, you won't expect much feedback for yourself. If you take up career where your function becomes the core department (or controlling one) you will see lots of feedback even if you didn't ask for it. 8. Everyone is busy The higher ups are always busy. Either they are busy fighting lot of pressures to meet demands or they are busy dreaming and expanding. Only organization who is not extreme hungry on growth but still do great job in holding existing customer well, actually have a real channel of feedback after relationship evolves a great time. More often than not when we see customer walking out suddenly is a sign that no one really bothered to understand their problems. It is when strategic functions of business are jumping in the focus, real feedback doens't come to business itself, let alone the last curious guy! Sorry, if this was too long -but i think this is a real challenge in most places i have seen."
715,"When you don't know the candidate too much, but do wish if he gets in the job, here is what you should do. Understand what his profile really is. Take his profile and tell him, you will check whether there is a suitable position in the company. Tell him clearly you can't promise anything. Talk to HR and or relevant departments and share with them the profile. Check to know whether he/she fits very well in any position. Always tell them ""No obligation"". They can consider him if fit but don't pressure them. Convey the message as per above - so if there is position and someone thinks she/he would be great fit it is always good. If someone thinks NO - tell your friend that they don't have an opportunity right now. Another possibility could be that he is interviewed but either got rejected or got lost against any other candidate. Help if that is appropriate to get feedback and convey, but do not pressure them to give preference to your friend. Last - never attach yourself related to any salary negotiation. In all cases, you should follow things up to some extent but if you don't find any positive response (If they are only being nice by saying ""We are considering"") don't push too much on either side. So here is the overall policy. Just be the messenger. and a good one. Be honest in all your communication. Do not pressure anyone or take pressure from someone. Do not try to push anyone's choices. Keep no guilt. Do your best and no more! If a great profile has filled a good job position - you have done a good job. If the there is no job or no fitment between the candidate and job it was never your fault anyway!"
716,"Have Faith No I didn't mean have faith that the person will become competent automatically. Have faith that over time people will realize what is wrong and who is wasteful resource in the larger picture. The symptoms you showed are applicable to both nepotism as well as for under performing populists (many of them are definitely the cardinal-nephews). The first thing is not to get irritated, angry and spoil your own repo or take on some war of justice just because you see things your way. [May be you are a cool guy so that's not much for you!] Keep up the company/organization spirit! if you can, do help them without really thinking much about ""not-my-job"". If you do have to fight, fight issues not people. Always be objective in meeting so that no one can accuse you back. Understand that higher ups do want results after all. So keep up your job and keep informing your immediate (or effective) boss that you have fixed the problems (on someone's behalf). Keep improving your repo and first establish that your views gets enough influence. As long as possible, ""let them fail"". If they are in a roles that doesn't block your work, avoid them till things become a problem. Or answer them sticking to your limited capacity and let them fight their problem. The more of their failures visible, more miserable the management becomes in supporting those people and their actions. Be assertive in meetings and raise the problem issues. All communication (which is visibly unbiased) should be highlighted. Let the under performers just receive their due labels. It is not that people don't know who are the suckers! It is just that these people are protected. Whenever crises occur, people mostly know whom to turn to; that's where you can pinch anyone and they will listen to you without choice. Of course, in organizations where appraisals and promotions are not truly performance based, probably there is no other solution than you getting your own influence before you can fight. Till then, wishing you luck!"
717,Ask the interviewer to provide you feedback and if he doesn't provide then file a RTI(Right to information act). You will surely get the reply. But it depends on country in India RTI is very powerful and anyone can file online to get information from anyone.
718,"You will not get any sort of feel for the office. This is important, especially if you will be working there after your internship. Most interns have some sort of ""in-the-office"" experience. Not having this prevents you from: communicate with teammates being present for meetings and such having a good feel for the team etc. Really, being in the office is always better. And if you eventually get a job, do not work remotely."
719,"One of the questions I always ask at the end of an interview is ""Do you have any reservations about my suitability for the role?"". If they have any, it's a good opportunity to address them, if they don't, then you can probably assume that you did OK. I've asked this in every interview I've ever had (6 in 10 years at time of writing), and have never not been offered the job. The first time I asked it was for my first big job in London, and they had lots and lots of reservations, but by addressing them, I got the job!"
720,"There is much more to be learned from being in office beyond simply how to fit in well with the team, etc, etc. The primary thing that I would be looking for from any internship, in any field, is the opportunity to observe people who are skilled and successful at their job at work . With specific reference to programming, in most cases this goes beyond a simple ability to write code or design frameworks - these things can be learned from books. They are typically much ""softer"" skills, like communication or teamwork. It includes things like the manner in which they interact with people around them, the way the choose to lead or follow, the way they give feedback to people, etc. These are the things that are most valuable to an intern, and none of them can be learned remotely."
722,"How can I improve communication at a virtual office?. I just started working at a virtual office. I am finding that communication is harder as people have different schedules but you're not sure when they're around, if they're online, if they're available, etc.  How can I have good communications with my fellow co-workers when we are all virtual?"
723,"To aid communications, you need to ensure that everybody logs into some messaging system - Skype for example - as soon as they're ""at work"" and there should only be one system you all use. This way you can quickly see who's available and who isn't. If you can, try to keep to a regular schedule so that everyone knows that you'll be available at the same time each day. Video calls via web cams could help here as well. Having a shared calendar that marks holidays, business trips away will also help for the times when you have to break your schedule. Giving each other plenty of warning about appointments etc that mean late starts or early departures will also help. If you aren't too geographically dispersed, arrange regular physical meetings. This should be both business meetings on work time and social meeting outside of work time. These will help you ""bond"" with your co-workers."
724,"Depending on how much influence you have at the company, it's worth suggesting that you all draw up an agreement between you as to how communication should be managed. Any companies that I've worked at virtually, the policy has always been that if you are not in an office you still need to behave as if you are i.e. during working hours you should be contactable by whatever form e.g. IM, Skype, email, phone etc. If you can agree this policy then you can be comfortable that there are no barriers to you contacting colleagues. And as ChrisF points out a shared schedule is a significant part of this and also regular face-to-face business meetings and social meetings."
725,"Although I don't work virtually, the places that I've worked that allow people to have virual office days have tended to have some guidelines to help reduce communication problems caused by people being in different locations. The first is consistant hours. The concept of ""core hours"" exist in the office, and also apply to people working remotely. These are hours where they are expected to be available via the corporate IM network, email, and phone. Everyone on the team is expected to be working during these hours, with the exception of vacation or sick time. Core hours are, in my experiences, about 5-6 hours of the day, with the other 2-3 hours being at your convenience. The next would be to keep everyone aware of your hours. In the office, people tend to have a signboard on their cube or office door indicating their schedule. It has their preferred email address, phone number, and an on-site point of contact (typically their supervisor). If they are taking any time off or will be unavailable, it is indicated on this. The use of shared calendaring systems also helps as people can indicate times when they have meetings (real or virual), vacation hours, or have allocated times to work that requires minimal disruptions. Finally, people only tend to work a few days a week virtually. It might be helpful to pick a single day where everyone works in the office to attend to things that can not be done remotely. It also provides a good social bonding for the team, so consider a team lunch (even if it's in the cafeteria) on these days to try to make sure everyone's working well together."
726,"Nepotism is a difficult problem to solve unless you are in charge, or the company is serious about tackling the issue.  One of the main problems is often family will work for less money and be more loyal to a company than an outsider.  Often the trade off is that they are often promoted over more qualified individuals and even put into positions they are not able to effectively handle.  The problem exists pretty much through out the free market. Usually the easiest thing to do is just find a different job.  However in some areas(I am guessing where you are in Greece would be included) this is not really an option. You can take advantage of laws and regulations that protect workers. Often, nepotism leads to unprofessional behavior and a hostile work environment.  In the US and many other western countries the law protects workers from this. You can consult a legal professional about your options. This will not win you any points with your management but if are willing to change the company for better at the cost of your career this is an option.  Because while the law may protect you from direct retribution it does not guarantee you will actually be considered for promotions, or and extra firm stance on work standards. If your company is large enough you may be able to unionize.  While, I would generally be against this step, if the problems are bad enough, and the company is strong enough, a union may make sense.  If you are already in what is generally considered a management position(most of IT is,) this option is probably not going to help you."
727,"Sometimes it's not about what you didn't have, but what someone else did, so I wouldn't be kicking yourself over it - I've conducted countless interviews where I had candidates that were very good, but then have found someone who has completely blown me away - if that person wasn't there, would I have offered the job to someone else? Absolutely. It's sometimes hard for someone else to understand that if you try to explain it, though. Otherwise, you need to make sure that you take the opportunity to get an honest answer from your interviewers about how your interview went and if you have anything lacking whilst you've got them as a captive audience. Recruitment is often many hiring mangers' least favourite part of the role, and they get put further and further behind of their everyday work. Try to get a proper answer, and interpret the answers you do get as needed - is someone talking in very generic terms about what the next steps would be? Might not have gone as well as you'd like. Do they talk about what they would see you personally bringing to the role? This is a good sign, as they've been clearly considering you as the interview has gone on. If you've missed this opportunity, in order to not massively annoy the hiring manager/HR, I'd suggest letting it go, so as not to burn a bridge."
729,"How can I talk to my boss one-on-one with confidence?. I am quite confident at work and with the work I do, and have a good relationship with my boss in the office. But when it comes to one-on-one meetings in which I present my plans and strategies for the next project, I stammer while speaking. I do not have this problem with my boss in normal day-to-day communication. When it is time for one-on-one meetings, I know that I am prepared and I am confident in my thoughts, but I find it difficult to make eye contact and explain what I have planned. How can I overcome this problem?"
730,One more reason to add to the answers already given. The company may be using an outside recruiter and the recruiter is posting the ad on the job board and not the company directly. In this situation where the company wants the recruiter to do some vetting of candidates before HR looks at them they may not post the ad on their own site to avoid being contacted directly by the candidate.
731,"Unless you want to invest the effort to investigate if they guy is really a good candidate, I'd suggest trying going the route of Introducing him to the right people in the company instead of full-on recommending him. This means that you should have a conversation with the HR person first and make it clear that you don't personally know much about the candidate other than a personal relationship, but you'd appreciate the favor of giving him an audience with HR or the hiring manager."
732,"It's harder to make a good impression on people when they only know you from remote work. In an internship, part of what you want is a recommendation or a job offer. Interns who are present may make a stronger impression on the hiring managers than someone who is only a disembodied line of text. I'm not saying you can't make a good impression working remotely, only that you will have to work much harder to do so. Further, you, as a person early in his or her career, need to get a feeling for office politics and how that affects work decisions and, most importantly, how to play the game effectively yourself. It is far easier to learn this stuff when not working remote. Most people coming out of school don't have any feel for this at all and it is critical to your workplace success. From a programming perspective, you are less likely to be in on a lot of the discussions of what to do and how to do it that are made in the architecture of a new project. Even if you are on the phone, it is harder to get a chance to speak and easier for people to forget you are there or were there and had something to contribute. So even if you do contribute, you are less likely to get credited in people's minds. You won't be there for the informal discussions either where people throw ideas around and you won't be sought out informally as a source of ideas. Part of that is because people tend to seek ideas from other people that they know and as an intern working remotely, no one will know you. So you are more likely to be given routine tasks that no one else wants to do because you aren't in on the conversations where this stuff gets divvied up and because people will forget you are there because they don't physically see you. You need to use the internship to learn to work professionally with a team. You need to see how your work affects others and how others' affects you. As an intern, it is easier to dismiss you from consideration and just let you work your time out remotely than to try to mentor you if you have difficulties in this area. People in the office are likely to get more guidance on working together as their presence can be disruptive if they don't play well with others. The remote person can just be ignored. They don't necessarily plan to keep you as an employee, so there is less incentive to try to help you when they don't know you personally or have to deal with you in the office (where you might be affecting others). Now some of this is mitigated if the office has a lot of good remote workers as the management is more used to dealing with people remotely. However, as an intern you are lowest on the totem pole and won't automatically have the respect that new co-worker with 10 years of experience who starts out working remotely has. An additional consideration is that as an intern you will be learning how to program professionally and how the real world of paid programming works. If you are remote, you also have to learn how to effectively work remotely. That means you have twice as much to learn as someone who is working in the office. That might work for you if you have the right personality type, but it is more likely that you will end up learning less by being remote in both arenas and thus not gain what you want to gain from the internship."
733,"How can I stabilize a hectic project without offending the unofficial Project Manager?. I recently changed jobs and was assigned to a project at the new job that is in serious need of some stabilization and cohesion.  The project has been in the works for 3 years and involves many different interdependent pieces which are being handled by different departments. To come up to speed and do my part of the project, I've had to get information from each of the different departments and read some documentation. During this process, I've found that, due to a lack of effective communication, each department has a different idea of where the project is going and what needs to be done.  Furthermore, the documentation is outdated and contains a great deal of false or misleading information. Each time I bring up an example of conflicting documentation or information that I'm getting, the usual response I get is ""Yeah, so-and-so has been out of the loop."" or ""I thought we decided not to do that.  Maybe I'm wrong."" or ""That's old information.  Ignore that piece of documentation"".  So, the team knows that there is a communication problem and that the documentation is bad, yet everyone is moving forward with their piece of the project as if all is well. The project doesn't have an official Project Manager per se, but one of my superiors is sort of overseeing the whole thing, and he is very busy with other projects too.  What I'd like to do is get everyone together in one room for a meeting and clarify all of the points of miscommunication that I've discovered, and make a plan going forward that we all can agree on.  I have experience with this sort of thing and I have several good ideas that could really help the project.  However, I feel that if I call a meeting like this, the ""Project Manager"" will be offended.  When I've casually brought up the prospect of getting everyone together like this to him, he seems to want to avoid that.  I also get the impression that he thinks meetings are a waste of time and that the lack of stability and cohesion in the project are not really a problem. I don't want the project to be this much of a cluster f*ck, but I also don't want to rock the boat too much or come off as a new employee trying to take over everything.  What should I do?"
735,"I agree with your general sense - don't call a meeting that the Project Manager should call if you don't have the manager's blessing.  What follows is stuff I've done in this circumstance - buyer beware, however, I eventually got promoted to management because I kept doing stuff like this. :) Talk to the theoretical Project Manager Have a list (written down!) in front of you (not shared with him) on the problems and their impacts.  Don't be vague on this - have real examples - ""I just spent 3 days finding the ACTUAL answer to X problem because it wasn't written down and no one knew.  As it is, I'm only 60% certain I have the real answer"" and ""I've done similar 5 times in the first month that I've been here"".  Make the case for the problem - poor efficientcy/bad product - and ask if you can do the work and hold the meeting.  Doing the ""I have a problem & a solution"" double whammy is usually a winner. Start drawing an info flow chart. Both of what might actually work, and also what seems to be happening now.  If you can show the manager the chaos, you have a good case for resolving it.  Also, having the ""is this a good idea?"" picture before the meeting you propose is likely to save some time.  It's easier to throw rocks at a concept than to make the concept, especially when you have lots of people in the room. Have a proposal for what documents are ""Must haves"" and what can be ignored. Have a table, with specifics (URLs, file paths, current edit dates, versions, etc).  Chances are that you have only a fraction of the chaos happening out there.  Some people will come to this meeting thinking ""it isn't THAT bad..."" - when you ask for what you've missed from this list, and the team finds 30% more missing items (and the other half the team didn't even know half this stuff was out there), people will be convinced.  The path to sanity is not more documents, but to weed down to 1 or 2 really good documents and to have a very, very clear, unavoidable process for keeping them up to date. And - as an overriding theme - start these conversations with the thought that you may just be wrong.  When the new guy tells me that my project is a total mess, I tend to get defensive.  When the new guy tells me that he can't make sense of the chaos, he's afraid that perhaps there is only chaos, and he'd like to either understand the pattern of sanity, or help find a pattern for sanity - then I'm much more receptive... cause I know this guy is trying hard to make sense of it all, and since I think he's probably pretty smart, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he gave me -- and figure that maybe there really is only chaos and we need to fix the mess."
736,Is there somebody else in the office that can help you? If they have experience working with same boss they may be able to provide guidance regarding your preparation and presentation. Some managers have a style and personalty that makes this type of meeting difficult. The way they ask questions is misinterpreted as being disapproving. The manager may not even realize they are intimidating their employees. The mentor can identify if this is a problem that everybody has. Also the process of having them review your presentation in advance can you the confidence you need.
737,"Have you tried getting practice with someone else?  Grab a co-worker, and give him the same thoughts you'd give your boss.  You may not even need the feedback from your coworker about the nature of your ideas... just the practice in translating them from living in your head to coming out of your mouth. Conversely - a key for many public speakers (and even one on one can fit this) - is to understand the nature of adrenaline, take it into account and use your understanding of it to ride the wave.  Take deep breaths, forcibly relax your body, sit in a comfortable but attentive posture - do everything possible to convince your body (not your mind) that there is nothing to be afraid of.  It's not a logical thing, it's a visceral thing -so the answer is often not to think your way through it, but to use physical stuff - like breathing - to find your instinctive brain. A friend of mine who taught some new class material for the first time described her nerves as ""this material is still very precious to me - I don't know how it will be received or the impact it may have - and I want to protect it - so while I'm not nervous for myself, I'm protective of my fledging thoughts and how they will be received"".  That was about the best explanation of this type of adrenaline that I have ever heard."
738,"Something is making you more nervous in this situation than normal day=to=day conversation with your boss. You need to identify what that something is to come up with the best strategy for fixing the problem. You say you know you are prepared but your actions speak otherwise even if you don't intend them to. So maybe changing exactly how you are prepared and how you do the presentation will help. For instance, are you going into the conversation with written notes? How about a  Power Point presentation? If you present your plan using a formal presentation, you can spend a lot of the time looking at the screen and not the person which will help the eye contact problem. If you have written notes you know you won't forget something. If is truly is not preparedness, then some other issues might be: Your boss doesn't provide any signals that let you know if you are doing well or poorly. Therefore talking to him makes you feel uneasy since you can't tell how he is reacting. I had this problem when I was first in the work place and the trick is to ask him leading questions to get the feedback rather than relying on him to give it to you when it is not his natural style. You can also assume with these sorts of people that no news is good news. If you aren't getting bad feedback, assume you are doing well. Feeling that he is going to respond positively to what you have to say will make it easier to say it. Another reason for this sort of nervousness is that you feel you are going to tell him some news he won't want to hear. So if you think the project plan you have will be unacceptable to the manger, decide why and think of reasons to mitigate the problem. For instance, it is harder to go to the boss with a problem than just to say hi. However, if you go to him with a problem and a proposed solution, then you will feel more confident and he will be happier than just finding out about a problem. Another possibility is psychological. People who have been abused by authority in the past, tend to have difficulty speaking to authority figures later in life. Not being able to make eye contact is a possible sign of this. This is because the abused person  doesn't internally have a basic level of trust that the non-abused person has. The best solution here is to seek treatment."
739,"I can vouch for you, this fear is real. With my last boss, i had faced this. Note, i had been a free lancer facing customer directly, had a significant team in various jobs and even before my boss joined this current company (in the start up days) - i have already established myself as a significant achiever. I had nothing to fear and i had never feared with any one! But with him? what's the issue? What make us fear the client? the boss? a senior peer? or even a brat junior? The most important aspect is our ability communicate and put our point forward. Even if we are reasonably outspoken, fluent in the language you fear because you mostly loose the point. The person on the other hand (like facing lawyer) has some weird arguments which in most cases you are not prepared with answers - and right when you begin to loose - he(she) is right there to now put some decisions, actions and arguments right on the spot. You of course, don't get a chance to think about the answer and comeback and discuss. The matter is closed and pushed in your head! You kind of feel betrayed, lost, hurt and kind of giving up. For many having to eat non-sense from authority itself is insulting. I might sound very dramatic - but essential point is you fear and loose confidence because you have realize that you loose consistently against him/her and they misuse that fact. And more you surrender, more you loose the confidence, subsequently more often you surrender. It's a vicious circle! So what you do? Don't loose heart. Always try to catch up the agenda in the a prior so that you can think as much as possible from his/her point of view and pick some potential arguments. Try to check what is the point you are trying to drive. Sometime in an open meeting we go with free and open minded more to listen as the concern is raised.  (this is how actually it should be) but you should also mentally be prepared as to what is the point/agenda you want to safeguard. For example, when you know you are talking about some project - you want to drive decision on some critical action to be taken before much worse can happen. You may be persuaded and pressurized but just don't compromise. Stick to that - refuse! Just refuse if you need to. Sir/Madam, i don't agree with this. If i need to acomplish this,i JUST cann't take this route! And don't buckle. Once you face it, you get it right. Face the problems on its head and be prepared to listen illogical and be prepared to drop logic. Sometime when you just don't want to compromise - when rational is dropped be prepared to refuse logic and not surrender just stick to your point. Talk to senior, peers and best to the boss of the boss about the matters. In many organizations that may not be welcome; but speak to someone whom you think you can trust and who you think is genuine. This will release your pressure and fear at least and if there is authority, situation can be handled better. BUT, don't complain about the person. Speak only your agenda - and explain why you disagree. Ask gentle advise from HR and maintain good repo. Sometimes they won't have any say in strategic decisions but as you work closely, you kind of feel comfort. They would turn gears when things go very bad. Last but most important - understand this is not your first job and nor will be last. Be prepared to walk out - be prepared to walk out of meeting, walk out of department or even from job. When you know he/she cannot ruin your life you feel much more confident!"
740,"It's worth asking what the rest of the office does.  If you are the only telecommuter - I'd say no - for many of the reasons listed elsewhere - networking, out of the loop, missing the culture. However - if a substantial portion of the staff are 100% telecommuters - let's say 40% or more - then it may be alright, becuase the culture has evolved from a face to face thing, to something that can be experienced online."
741,"It does not sound like a sample project, it sounds like a TRIAL project.  They are treating you like a professionals whose skills they wish to make use of and evaluate -- so a small project to see how you do, a large project if they like your work. The key difference between a sample project and a trial project, is that they actually want the trial project done, not just to see if you can do it.  You should have treated this as any other project, a contract, terms, definition of work to be done, timeframe, who owns the code you write, all should've been spelled out. Whether they are evaluating you as a contractor, or a full time employee isn't clear to me, but it doesn't really matter -- when working for money, be clear.  You don't necessarily have to have pages and pages of legalese, but a signed document saying what is expected, yes, that you should have done. Now, the fact that they want to pay you for this project, should be taken as a very big plus on your evaluation of them.  They didn't try to get free work out of you under the guise of ""sample""."
742,"I think you are already aware of the problem The project doesn't have an official Project Manager per se An effective project manager doesn't just prepare schedules and assign tasks, they also clear roadblocks and enable effective communication.  The poor documentation and lack of communication going on right now are a result of not having a project manager. The current manager in charge of the project doesn't necessarily sound like he is doing an ineffectual job, he is more than likely just swamped with 800 other responsibilities that are of higher importance right now and really doesn't have the time to address this in a way that you feel this project deserves. Like Beth's answer above, come up with a list of all the problems and potential solutions that you identified and have a meeting with the manager.  Convey your opinion on the importance of the project and the desire to address these problems. The best way you can do this is volunteer to act as project manager on his behalf for this project.  Try to convince him/her to give you responsibilities and abilities that would normally come with such a role.  It will help identify you as somebody with their heart in the right place, somebody who wants to get into management and somebody who is wanting to help him/her deal with responsibilities that they personally sound too busy to deal with. On that note I leave you with a Cautionary Tale .  Before you suggest possibly being the project manager on this project, make sure that your manager is not a psychopathic control freak first.  I once made a similar pitch to such a control freak that was in the office 14 hours a day and floundering in more responsibilities than he could handle and it turned out quite terribly for me.  He got absurdly defensive and assumed I was gunning for him and his role, which I did not want.  He made a point to be hyper-critical of everything I did from that point on and targeted me for demotions and punishments over tiny mistakes.  Needless to say I didn't stick around long, but just watch out for the crazies."
743,"The only way to truly overcome fear is with practice.  I occasionally play the organ at church.  A lot of people tell me they could never do such a thing because it would scare them to death, and ask how I manage it.  My response is that it did scare me to death every week for the first 3 years, but I persisted, and one day I realized I wasn't scared any more. That being said, the best thing that helped my frame of mind in your situation is to realize that your boss' position over you is only administrative.  It doesn't imply he's a superior person, or even better qualified to do your job than you.  Think of him as a peer, and further than that, as someone who can't do his job without you. You were chosen to present your plans to him because you are in a better position to formulate those plans than he is.  You have the upper hand in your knowledge of the project details, and if he's a good manager he will defer to you.  His only job is to make sure your plan lines up with the bigger picture of your company's goals, and to impart his experience to help your plan run smoothly.  Don't take corrections personally, be enthusiastic about the superior plan you were able to come up with together."
744,"Keep in mind - not all reasons for non-selection are worth changing or a candidate's fault.  I agreed with quite a few answers here - that I wouldn't write such feedback largely due to the litigious nature of US hiring practices and the time it takes to do so.  I do give this information to HR, and would authorize the HR department to provide candidates with feedback as they deem fit - HR (in the US) typically has a much tighter association with legal so the fear of lawsuits for them is significantly different than for a hiring manager. But - keep in mind - rarely does a candidate get a ""thumbs down"" from me because they are lame, not skilled, or personally irritating.  More likely, I will get a read on someone as a particular personality type (""ah, this guy LOVES tools and can make them sing"") and it may not match the diverse needs of my team (""too bad I have 3 guys like that... I need a person who loves testing things with that devious streak that really good testers have"").  It's not a strike against you, it's just a poor fit for the position. Agreed, it would be nice to get an email back saying ""it was nice meeting you, I'm sorry but I'm not going to give you feedback"" - but we seem to be horrible at the saying ""no"" part of US corporate communication."
745,Does putting LaTeX as a skill on my resume make me look too academic?. I know some LaTeX and plan on learning more to write papers and the like but is it something I should list on my resume when applying to the business world? I've heard tale that one should look as un-academic as possible. Would LaTeX be too much?
746,"This depends on what exactly you're applying for. If you're applying to a company that produces textbooks and they use LaTeX for their typesetting it would definitely be a plus. If you're applying to a college/university or a shop with lots of *NIX systems/people around they'll probably know what LaTeX is, and it can't hurt to list it (I consider it a plus personally). If you're applying to be a grocery store cashier or some other field so far removed from publishing/typesetting/academia and other areas where LaTeX shows up the folks interviewing you probably won't even know what LaTeX is - at best you'll have to explain, and at worst they'll probably think you have some strange fetishes. Bottom line: Tailor your resume to the job you're applying for when you send it directly to an employer.  If you're putting something up on Stack Overflow Careers or Dice/Monster/Etc. go ahead and list it, as it's one more thing someone can search by."
748,"It does not make you look too academic. 'Too academic' sounds like there was a downside to being academic, which I don't feel there is. Having ""C#"" as a skill in my ""CV"" does not make me look too much of a ""software developer"", does it?"
749,"An outside interview is highly unlikely to give feedback, an internal one might be more willing if you go to him or her with the right attitude.  You don't want the person to have the impression that you are asking so you can fight the selection. When I have been successful with this in the past, I said something to the effect of ""I realized from the interview that I'm not ready yet for that promotion. Could you give me some guidance on what I need to do to be ready for the next opportunity."" Since you aren't going to get feedback from the interviewer most of the time, you have to learn the skill of self-assessing your own performance. First don't beat yourself up too badly, I have often hired one person when 4 or 5 would have been great fits for the job, but I only had one position. If your honest self assessment was that you did well, then this may have been the case. Sometimes it comes down to how you think the personalities will fit together and what might be wrong one for one postion might just be perfect for the next. So to self-assess yourself, first go through a mental checklist: Was I prompt, decently dressed and clean? Did I make eye contact
(very important in the US) and have a firm but not aggressive
handshake? Did I appear to be organized? Was I nice to the
receptionist (they get asked about you more than you might be aware). Did I ask good questions? Did I try to sell myself without getting
pushy about it? Did I notice any time when the tone of the interview changed (If it
happened that was likely the answer where you ruled yourself out)? What questions did I feel like were my weakest answers, If I had it
do again, what could I say instead? Could my behavior have been interpreted as arrogant? Did they ask technicial questions that I couldn't answer correctly? Did I talk about my accomplishments and not just the tasks I am
assigned to do? Did the job as they described it to me in the interview seem to be a
good fit for my existing experience or would it have a been a
stretch? If I had been interviewing someone like me for a simliar job, how
would I have ranked this person? Sometimes it really helps to put
yourself in the interviewer's shoes and see things from her
perspective. Pretending it wasn't you, ask yourself, ""What strong
points did this person have, what weak points?"" Ask yourself if the work enviroment would really have been one you would have enjoyed in the long run. Often when you aren't the right fit, you would have hated working there if you had been hired. Did they seem more bureaucratic than you want, did they seem as if they wanted more experience not just a willingness to learn, were the office spaces ones you would have been comfortable working in? Did you like the people who did the interviewing? Did there seem to be alot of tension in the air? You are often going to interview in places where really you can be happy you didn't get the job, yes even in big name places like Amazon or Google."
750,"One thing that people often misunderstand is that even in a relaxed culture, you are being paid to produce. If Joe surfs the web all the time and never meets deadlines or sells product or whatever his job is, then yes this is a problem. If Jane also does this but also solves the hard problems, meets the deadlines and keeps the client happy, well then it is less of a problem. I remember one really relaxed place I worked where we had a sales guy who was really relaxed about his tasks (and hours for that matter), but he didn't sell anything and so was let go in about 3 months. If you are going to be seen slacking, you had better also be seen producing. In a more bureaucratic environment, it might be a problem all around as they find it hard to explain to the 9,000 mediocre employees why the 10 great employees have privileges that they do not."
751,"Since you mentioned you only joined it ""recently"", I think the first thing you need to do is to figure out the people and relationships before you try anything. Stuff that has dragged on that long typically have a LOT of ""emotional"" stakeholders and are politically tricky. In most cases, the people involved DO know what is wrong but haven't done anything and you need to find out the WHY. Is it because the different teams have bad blood? How bad is it? Would they rather have the other party fail than to have the project succeed? Why aren't they communicating? Have they gotten to the point where they don't even WANT to talk to each other because of politics? 
Why is there no official project leader? Because the team leaders don't want to put themselves in a position where they will probably fail? Maybe not everyone in top management wants it to succeed for personal reasons? Who knows? Sit back and figure out all you can about the relationships between the teams and team leaders before you go blundering in there. Listen to colleagues more, talk less, figure out what the heck is REALLY happening. One thing to remember is that when management WANTS to get things done, they can. Else they would have been out of business a long time ago. If it hasn't happened then there must be a reason, you need to find out why management chooses to ignore the pink elephant that has been in the living room the past three years. Then decide if you really want to get involved and how you want to approach it. *If it really is a political issue, wait until top management finally decides to do something about it before you do anything since you won't have the clout to change anything anyway."
752,"If it will be used in your job, then heck yeah. Never even think about not putting something useful (within your job) on your resume. But, if you don't want to look to academic, there are ways to prevent that. For example: Known Technologies Include: Java C LaTeX Python ... Is like saying to look academic. It's like saying, ""Look I went to school and I know all of these cool things because I'm awesome."" On the other hand: Have [fill number here] years experience in Java and C. Work comfortably with Python and LaTeX. ... Is more like saying ""Well, I went to school, and I'm proud of it, but I don't like to brag."" ;-) So, yeah, put it on your Resume, just be careful how you word it."
753,"My question to you is what benefit would you gain from putting LaTex on there? I try hard not to put a single word on my resume that won't help me get the actual positions I want. If I don't intend to work in a technology, for instance, I won't put it on there even if I have experience with it.  If you are applying for jobs where this technology would be helpful, add it, If not, then something else might be a better use for the space."
754,"Do you have a team/company wiki?  I have seen this used very effectively by ""the new guy"" to record ""stuff I'm figuring out"" and ""stuff I'm confused about"" -- as personal pages, not project pages, but since most people monitor recent changes they see this.  A wiki, unlike sending email, is a broad invitation to contribute, so someone who can answer one of your questions can add a note without being sucked into the ensuing email chain or signing up to do more. If you don't have a wiki, you can still keep those lists.  Schedule a recurring meeting with your manager (""newcomer ramp-up"", not forever), and go over those issues (specifically, as @bethlakshmi said). Asking questions and seeking clarification will illustrate the problem in concrete terms, without evoking a ""new guy has all the answers, grr"" response.  As you get answers you can organize this information for broader use, and maybe that will make the unofficial project manager receptive to you helping out more officially."
755,"I'd probably focus a bit on making sure I have a list of character references within the company to support why I'd be a good fit for the new position.  Knowledge of the company isn't likely to be a big focus in the interview though it may be worth knowing what department the new position is, what changes would I be taking and how is this a good move for the company for me to move to there from here. The reference point here is a bit different since these may be mutual acquaintances unlike the other case where in an external company there may not be that same depth to the business relationship."
760,"How can one recover after misspeaking in an interview?. I recently had a phone interview and it went so-so. I think I asked a couple of good questions, but I also think I asked at least one bad one. This is how to conversation went... Me: ""What do your developers complain to you the most about on a daily basis?"" Manager: ""They usually complain about other developers not doing their job well because they are not qualified."" Me: ""Why are there so many unqualified developers in the team? Is it due to interviewing practices?"" Note... the wording might not have been exactly the same as above. I am also not a native English speaker (not like that would be an excuse) I think my last question was out of line. I did not mean to suggest that they are not conducting a good interview. It was just pure curiosity but thinking back it is definitely a black mark on my record. Is there a good way to recover from this after the fact? If I realized my stupidity then, I would have said something, I would have admitted it was a bad question. But what can I do now? Hours, possibly days after the interview? In general, what can one do to recover from situations like this?"
762,"Perhaps you could write a thank-you email to this effect: Greetings so-and-so, It was a pleasure talking to you about x position over the phone the other day.  I wanted to thank you for the opportunity as I am very excited about this prospect. In addition, I wanted to let you know that I was mulling over our exchange in my head, and I felt I may have said a few things that kind of crossed the line.  If this is the case, I assure you this was out of zealousness and I didn't mean any ill-intent. If you have further questions about my qualifications, feel free to contact me.  I am looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, c_maker"
763,"You can always recover to some extent from a miscue in an interview, but the key is timing. First, I would agree with your assessment that your response was not the greatest thing you could possibly have said in that situation.  But, learn from it (don't do it again!) and move on.  Also, more often than not in phone interviews, not everyone (especially if there are multiple people in the line) is hanging on your every word, and more so at the end (it's often a time for compilation of notes before moving on to the next person to call). So, how to recover from a miscue?  Some thoughts: If it's early in the interview and you're being asked something factual and you just mess up, just say something to the effect of ""wait a minute, let me backtrack"" and restate what you were trying to say. If it's in the middle of the interview, do the same, but try to make a split-second decision if your explanation is really valuable or puts you in a better position than not, because they will have a script they want to get through in a certain amount of time. In your specific situation of a miscue at the end, in the ""discussion"" phase, I would just let it go especially if they didn't give you any indication that they were upset, and if you are not immediately comfortable smoothing it over (many people can't, and end up making it worse). Sometime between ""just after"" and ""a few days"", you should be writing a polite thank-you note anyway, to thank the company for the opportunity to interview and reinforcing your desire to work for them.  What I would actually not do is say ""Oh, remember when I insulted your hiring practices? Please don't hold that against me."" Instead, be brief, polite, and grateful -- remind them why they wanted to interview you in the first place, and don't specifically call out something that they might not even have heard, taken seriously, or even remembered to the extent that you do.  Let that be the last impression they have of you, and do that as soon as possible."
764,"It is Time Dependent. If you realize it on the spot, ""as you are saying it"", give a quick chuckle and ""of course, I don't mean you "" to disarm them with a little humor.  Don't go overboard though, no hysterical laughing or being too loud in comments. If you realize with 5 minutes say ""by the way, just now, when I said about poor interviewing, I just meant generally not you or recently"" By the end of the interview - bring it up during the ""questions"" period if it bothers you. After you've left / when you get home / the next day / week / month, forget it.  Reaching out at that point would be seen as peculiar."
766,"What are effective means of dealing with mistakes made by an individual?. Placing blame doesn't seem appropriate or beneficial when working with teams. On the other hand, the management team's first instinct is to hold each other accountable. What is an effective measure of dealing with mistakes ex post facto? How or what methods are most effective in terms of proactively coaching the individual so the risk of reoccurance is minimized?"
767,"If your management team's first instinct is to start pointing fingers and assigning blame then quite frankly your management team is dysfunctional. The best advice I can give you for dealing with a crisis, no matter what precipitated it: FIX THE CURRENT PROBLEM . I don't give a flying fart who caused it, and neither should anyone else at this stage: if something is broken, FIX IT . Worry about blame later. Anyone standing around playing the blame game is less than worthless at this point. That especially includes management, who should make a concerted effort to stay the heck out of the way of the people who are actually trying to fix the problem . Assuming you are a manager, your job right now is to keep everyone else out of your team's hair.  Fixing a problem takes time. It takes 10 times longer if every layer of management between you and the CEO is hovering around asking how much longer. Perform an honest, open post-mortem. Determine why - more specifically determine The Five Whys . Make sure you've found the root cause, and identify as many contributing causes as you can. Every person and department involved in the incident should be involved in this post-mortem.  Expect the investigation to take at least a man-week (across all involved people) for any truly significant incident, and expect additional time to analyze the findings. Anything disclosed in this investigation should never be used to penalize an employee, and if an employee admits to screwing up they shouldn't be penalized for speaking up during the investigation (within reason - obviously gross misconduct and the like are what they are). NASA's ASRS is a good model for the investigation process. Develop a plan to prevent it from happening again. If it's an individual mistake, carelessness, etc. counsel the person privately.  Explain how their actions caused (or substantially contributed to) the problem, and discuss with them how they could have done things differently/better. If at all possible let the employee come up with the better strategy. Remember, it's a learning experience, not ""pin the blame on the donkey"". If you approach this in a punitive way your employees will start paying pass-the-blame to cover their own exposure rather than truly analyzing how to do better next time. If it's a total team failure take the team aside and do the same thing. Ensure this doesn't degrade into team-members pointing fingers: The team failed, the team must decide how to work better in the future. If it's a management failure get the various management levels together first and discuss it. Own the mistake as managers, and figure out how you can avoid screwing up in the future, then get together with your team and apologize for making their lives harder, explain how you'll avoid it in the future, and get their input. Actually FOLLOW THROUGH on the plan you develop. Too often the plan involves things like intensive cross-training, bringing in an expert to assess a particularly complex area, spending major money on infrastructure, etc. -- management is all for the solution until they see the price, or realize that resources (people) will be tied up and unavailable for billable work. If you don't follow through on the plan to prevent reoccurrence you are dooming yourself. Additionally your company should create a formal investigative process for the post-mortem tailored to the kind of work you do, which should include some form of documentation for the investigation and its conclusions so you can use them to refine your procedures/training in the future. The Five Whys as already mentioned are a good component of that process, but they're only a starting point."
768,"First off, it can be very important to realize that what you perceive as mistakes may be viewed (by those committing them) as rationalized acceptable behavior. Therefore, directly confronting individuals who've made mistakes can be... counter-productive. What is an effective measure of dealing with mistakes post de facto? Before anything else, set about fixing it. The more time you waste in allowing mistakes to fester, the more damaging they are. If you're the supervisor, this is your job; if you're not, this is your opportunity to prove you're capable. How precisely you manage a mistake is dependent upon the mistake. However you do it, make sure that your attitude is that of ""I do this for the team"" not ""Somebody had to clean up his mess"". How or what methods are most effective in terms of proactively coaching the individual so the risk of reoccurance is minimized? ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't it drink."" Lead by example; if you demonstrate how to do it right, trust that the group will look to you for guidance in the future. If they don't, someone needs to go – unfortunately, if the problem is constant despite your best efforts, that someone may be you. Being direct is, again, counter-productive; you'll come across as a know-it-all and alienate the rest of the team. However, being the paragon of the team will inspire and lead your team to new heights. To do this, you have to show them that: You're capable of doing the right thing as asked. You can demonstrate why it's right. You do so without being asked. You're working to move up in the world, and, presumably, keep your job. Being humble and showing that you know the right way to do the job isn't just the sign of being a good worker, but a good leader."
770,"If you have identified an internal position that you want, your best bet is to get your current manager to advocate on your behalf in support of your candidacy.  In most companies I've seen, the first thing hiring managers/HR do with internal applicants is to speak with the employee's current boss. On that same point, your current boss is going to hear about your application, so he/she might as well hear about it from you.  Explain why you are interested, how the new position would help your career development, and how you taking the new job would help the company.  Ask your boss for his/her thoughts and to provide a positive reference for you."
771,"First off all, i think we are taking granted the term ""Mistake"" without definition. Don't make that mistake . Poor management can cause mistake of all types including but not limited to: a. Misunderstanding the task b. Insufficient resources or situation to handle, c. A communication gap (or lack of information) d. Inadequacy of process e. Lack of skill/training f. Rare exception / first time events g. Personal judgement errors h. Personal goof-up When something goes wrong, it is time to learn. First off, instead of assuming anything, get to a senior who is the authority. Explain everything as is. Put the facts in right (unbaised) order - and ensure that you supply proper data to backup. Listen to your senior about what is the scheme of things under his mind, and how you could have done it right in the same situation. Ensure that everyone is in agreement as to what is the real reason of what went wrong. [This is easier said than done!] Clearly make a plan for how to correct the current mess. Submit your apology (even formally if needed) to all concerned (but only those who concerned) Learn from the mistake and move on. Overall, in case of all incidents, we must focus on what is wrong , why it went wrong and what to do now . You should never go personal about a tech/process/business issues."
772,Is it acceptable to use pirated software on the job?. Is it a acceptable to use pirated software to do your job without telling your boss about it? I find that rather than getting your employer to buy the software it's easier to use a pirated copy to do your work and without mentioning that the software wasn't properly licensed. It often seems nobody really asks or cares how you got the work done as long as it gets done...
773,"It is an extremely bad idea! While you may not personally care about the law, the company can get into trouble because of your actions. The company policy might want to prevent misuse of any software including the risk involved due to pirated software. You don't necessarily own the resources of the company and hence don't quite have the right to do stuff against said policy. If there is a need for the tool in order for you to really perform work, then company should pay for it or provide you with alternative tools. It definitely will hurt the society; It may hurt the company and it may hurt you as well."
774,If you steal software for your company then you can get both you and them into a lot of trouble (including fines big enough to make the company go bust).  A lot of companies (e.g. Microsoft) make much more of an effort to persue corporate piracy than consumer.
775,"Most software is available as a demo version. You can use this trial to demonstrate the benefit of this software (such as increased productivity) and then show the results to your boss. If you can persuade him, you'll get this software legally. If you can not, then let it be ! The responsibility for the leak of productivity (if there really is any) then is on someone else. Question yourself: Why do you want to risk anything?"
776,"No, don't do it!! It will not only get your company in trouble, it will also put you at risk as well, and potentially  end up with a criminal record. Some software publishers such as Microsoft will conduct site audits to make sure that all software are being used legally, and with the appropriate license. If you find that you need a particular tool to do your job, convince your company to buy it. Again, No, don't do it!!"
777,"No , it is not acceptable to use pirated software to do your job, in fact it could lose you your job . In the UK, the use of pirated software would usually be considered gross misconduct and be grounds for summary dismissal , so as risks go, that's a pretty big one. As others have mentioned, the reason companies treat this so seriously is because the consequences for the company can be grave. In the UK, The Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) publicises the legal penalties and security risks for piracy and prosecutes both organisations and individuals  on behalf of its members. They also promote the use of Software Asset Management to help companies avoid copyright infringement. Even using software provided by your company, if you know it to be pirated , could result in pretty dire consequences - it's not impossible that you could be considered to be a conspirator and personally liable. Under such circumstances, ethically you should report the infringement to FAST (in the UK) and any repercussions for this should be covered by whistleblower legislation. The situation in the US, or in any of the countries around the world whose legal system is based on the UK/UK models, would be pretty much the same. The specific laws, crimes and enforcement agencies would be different, but the essential principal and the ethics of the situation would be identical."
778,"Are there any strategies you can use to remain focused when working in an open plan environment?. I work in an open plan office that houses about 50 to 60 people. It is mostly engineers at their desks working away, so it is a typical office environment. As you can imagine, sometimes, the noise and the distractions (visual and physical) can get in the way of focusing and doing work. Sometimes, I try to get back focus by putting a set of headphones in and listening to some music, or booking a meeting room for about an hour to work in private. However, these are sub-optimal. What strategies can I use to get focus back?"
779,"Try to do the right thing. I've been in many organizations where the culture of piracy was rampant. Ironically, these were tech firms... Sometimes there's resistance to buying licenses. Perhaps it depends on the size of the company. You can get the organization in quite a bit of trouble by doing this, though. Cover yourself. If you can't obtain the tools necessary to do your job, there's a bigger problem. If you can't sell/justify the need for those tools, there's a bigger problem."
780,"To add to some already good answers... There's two types of feedback - internal performance and external impact As someone in the 0-5 year range of a software engineering role, it is likely and expected that the direct feedback given to you by your management is internal, not external.  For most roles (plenty of exceptions) a junior person is not given direct exposure to customer feedback, because they are not given direct responsibility for resolving the issues that may be part of that feedback.  Those types of issues are typically bigger than the contributions of a single developer - they are team level, or even corporate culture level issues, that take multiple individuals to fix. In a perfect world, your manager would synthesize some of this feedback for your team and present it to you here and there as it suits the organization.  I've often done this, and my team has comprised everyone from college interns to people with 20 years of seniority.   In those cases, the manager is usually saying ""we did this"" and not picking out an individual - because for the most part, the effort is a team one.  Even when one person makes a stellar ""save"", they likely cannot have done it without the rest of their team being there to support them. It's not only OK, it's encouraged to ask for the impact of your work Saying ""how'd we do boss?"" is a perfectly wonderful question to ask management.  Hopefully they know how well their team is doing and what impact its work has had on the external world.  If they really seem to have no earthly idea, ask a bigger manager, or find a new job.  If there is no bigger manager with a clue like this, you are hitting danger signs, because it may very well be that your company is not fulfilling a business need, and that's not a good sign for company longetivity. A thought on interviewing Be very aware of the difference between ""I"" and ""we"" - both in conversations with your manager and in potential new jobs.  Since you do not have responsibility for the overall customer relationship, and since almost any reasonable sized project is more than a single individual - it is unlikely that you can claim solo credit for most significant accomplishments.  You can definitely take credit as part of the team - ""our product does X"", ""our product helped the customer these ways"", ""I worked fixing bugs that had this impact..."" - those are all great ways of putting it. If I were interviewing someone within the range I'm hearing (0-5 years in the field, medium level individual contributor, not responsible for customer accounts, but possible contact with customers in the course of bug fixing) - I would be looking for what you, yourself have done, and that would be the day-to-day - not the enormous picture.  I'd want to hear about particularly tricky bugs, particularly difficult customer communication, and things you did to improve your own efficiency and help those around you.  I would be surprised, confused and dubious if you quoted to me lots of metrics about how your work saved the customer money, time or increased company or customer profits.  If you gave me some general ideas of how the product , or your team does these things - bonus, but not necessarily a huge contributor to a hiring decision.  At your level, I'd be looking to see that you are in firm control of how to manage your own time, your own efficiency, and that you can contribute significantly to the team in such a way that the whole team is made better by your existence."
781,"We have mostly open seating too.  I share your pain. You didn't mention visual distraction, but that can be a big contributor too.  If you have any leeway at all over this, getting any sort of visual barrier can help immensely.  You might not realize how much people walking by in your peripheral vision can distract you until you cut it off. The biggest problem for most people, in my experience, is the noise.  If your objection to wearing headphones is that you're substituting the distraction of music for the distraction of the office, try noise-canceling headphones instead.  Some of my coworkers use them and they say it doesn't hinder them the way wearing earplugs would. If the problem with headphones is physical, not what's coming through them, then see how the people sitting nearby feel about white-noise generation.  It doesn't do much for the loud conversations, but it raises the floor some on what's enough noise to be distracting in the first place. These are only partial mitigations, not real solutions.  I suspect the only real solution involves not doing open seating, but that's out of scope."
782,"I have a nice set of custom in-ear headphones . Noise isolation without resorting to full-on noise-cancellation. The visual of employees wearing big headphones when visitors/clients come through is not a good thing (in some organizations). To keep focus, I work in 25-minute blocks using a modified Pomodoro technique . It's an easy way to keep focus on specific tasks."
783,"I used to install pirated software both at home and at the job. Seemed like a good idea and a justifiable shortcut, but, in reality, it was a bad idea. It's like cheating. Once you start, it's very hard to get back on the legitimate track and the returns are never as valuable as doing actual legitimate work. It's like a law of nature, and believe me, if I could go back to the day I began pirating software, I would choose not to and work hard to pay my dues legitimately. I know with every fiber of my being that I would be more successful today had I done that. I've never heard of anyone getting audited (outside of mergers), but, although that would definitely be a nightmare scenario, the audit is not what you should fear. The real negative effect is that you come to rely on unethical means for your operations. This is how corruption begins and it can grow beyond just pirating software after a while. It's human nature. Once you do something unethical, it's easier to justify other unethical behavior. What may start out as innocent software pirating, can grow into stealing hardware, then to cooking financials in spreadsheets, then to corporate espionage, then to even more unethical things like embezzlement, etc. You might think to yourself, ""I would never let it get beyond mere software pirating"", but that's the first justification. The second would be, ""I would never let it get beyond mere hardware theft"", etc. Watch Devil's Advocate sometime. :)"
784,"Is it a acceptable to use pirated software on the job without telling your boss about it? Acceptable to whom? Clearly it is acceptable to you, or you wouldn't be asking. If your question is ""is this acceptable to my boss?"" then the person you should be asking is your boss. Let us know how that conversation goes. It's certainly not acceptable to me."
785,"I want to approach this from a different perspective. I think the other answers have covered well what you do when there is a major mistake particulaly when complex processes are involved. However, not all mistakes are process driven. People still do the work and people make mistakes that are based on several things: Incompetence (or lack of knowledge about a particular issue not just
general incompetence) Exhaustion Personal stress unrelated to work(Divorce, death in the family, etc) Carelessness Distraction These are often not the kind of mistakes that drive the need for a massive effort to do post-mortem analysis.  But they do drive the need to deal with the individual who is making more than the occasional mistake. So let's deal with some of those possibilities. I'm going to lump incompetence and carelessness together as the process to deal with them is similar. First, explain to the person, what was wrong, why it was wrong and how to do it correctly. Then make the person make the fix. If they learn from this and don't continue to make the same mistake, then that's all that is needed. But people being people, this won't fix everyone. Some people will need private counseling about their problems and why they keep making them and may need to be put formally on a plan to fix their lack of skill or caring about the quality of their work. This needs to be a plan with consequences. If the person doesn't shape up after giving several chances to fix the problems they have, then you may need to let them go.  And they need to know this is a possibility if they don't fix what is wrong. It should never come as a surprise if you are getting let go for lack of performance. But that first talk shouldn't be the kiss of death either, if the person straightens up and improves, it should be possible to come off the performance improvement plan and be treated the same as the other employees. Now in the processing of the private discussions to find out why the mistakes are happening, you may find that distraction, exhaustion, or personal stress are involved. If distraction is causing a problem, then as a manager, you need to fix whatever is causing the distraction. That might mean not expecting the person to multitask, it might mean moving to a quieter location, it might mean having someone else handle technical questions or help desk calls or what ever is the thing that keeps pulling the person off task. Then see if performance improves. If exhaustion is involved (and is work-related), the manager probably is the one who made the mistake and should have noticed that the person was working too many hours. If the person is working more than 8 hours in a day, send him home and tell him not to come back until he has slept a full night. Then stop planning tasks so that they require more than 40 hours a week. Employee exhaustion is often the result of management errors. So take the blame and fix the problem.  Now sometimes an employee is exhausted due to other issues outside of work and those will come under the next paragragh discussing personal stresses. If the person tells you of outside reasons why he is making mistakes, then you need to assess those reasons and come up with a plan to mitigate them. Sometimes this means a short-term lightening of the load (as was done for me when my beloved died), sometimes it might mean moving to a less stressful position permanently (in the case of someone who will be under the stress for a long time, such as when somone has become a caregiver), it may mean checking their work more frequently. It might mean a change of schedule. It might mean putting him on medical leave or short term disability or part-time hours. It may mean telling him to quit that second job or requiring they get medical treatment for depression or insomnia or a whole host of other things. Anytime you need to go one step up from just having the talk about the mistake and how to fix it or the identification of a personal stressor that is affecting work that can't be fixed by a simple short-term rearrangement of work, you may need to get HR involved before you deal with the person directly. They are aware both of legal issues you may not be aware of and of possible resources (as well as ways and means as to how to do somthing like put someone on short-term disability) and company policies you need to follow. They are the manager's friend when there is serious performance problem that needs to be addressed."
786,"Like it or not. If you don't dress up for the interview, even in a casual dress workplace environment, the interviewer may think that you don't consider their position worthy of making an effort to look extra nice. It may also lead them to conclude that if the interview isn't worth your putting in a little extra effort then there will be plenty of tasks that the job requires from you that you would consider not worth your extra effort also. In other words, you risk creating an immediate negative first impression by not demonstrating that this interview is important enough to you that it makes you want to put in the extra effort to look nice. While I don't consider any of the places I have worked at (in 20+ years) as stuffy and all have been casual dress, I can't recall anyone that was hired who didn't show up for the interview in a suit or business dress (for women). I can recall several decent candidates who dressed casual but were turned down for various reasons which may have been amplified in their importance because of the negative first impression by not putting in such a simple extra effort as dressing up."
787,"In The Hot Seat Be immediately direct. Admit your mistake, but don't dwell. You're showing that you, like everyone else, make mistakes, but that you're able to correct them quickly and quietly with minimal embarrassment to you or the other party (i.e. the business). I once had an interview years ago where I caught myself saying something similar. Here was how I corrected it: I'm really sorry; I've been extremely nervous about this interview for days, and I tend to have a rather sarcastic sense of humor. When I'm nervous, I tend to say things that are rather inappropriate for the situation, but that in a more relaxed setting would probably be considered humorous... I apologize for my lapse in professionalism. At the end of the interview, he shook my hand and said: When you caught your mistake and corrected it, I really was impressed. Being able to admit your faults is a sign of a strong ethic. Later I went on to write an email to the interviewer, thanking them for the opportunity to interview, and again apologizing for my mistake. I was called back for a second interview, and made sure I was much more careful the second time around. Know Your Weaknesses Making the same mistake twice is professional suicide. I'm not going to sugarcoat this for you: If you know you have the tendency to make a mistake, you'd better make sure you have the ability to learn from it. If you're lucky enough to get a follow up interview, you'd better demonstrate a more professional demeanor the second time around. Likely, the first time you're interviewing with the HR director. The second time around, you're likely to be ganged up on by the HR director, and at least a VP you'd be working under. You won't get another chance at this point. If you are so lucky to get the opportunity to meet with the same HR director, thank them for the opportunity respectfully. Don't gush, but make it clear that you owe them . After all, the time it takes to interview you is generally in the neighborhood of 30-60 minutes on the lower-limit; the time it would have taken to shred your resume was approximately 45 seconds."
788,"Headphones tend to make your ears hot, especially the closed-back type which is preferable in an office environment like mentioned. I also can only wear for a max of about an hour then it gets too uncomfortable which in itself is a distraction. Also I tend to notice that the heat in these open plan environments is an issue as is the lighting. Right now it is nearly 25 degrees in our office and the humidity is extremely low at 25% making it feel hotter than it is.
There are several overhead luminaries each with 3 or 4 fluorescent bulbs in them scattered every 2 or 3 feet of which I have had to ask to be switched off. The lighting and air quality plays a massive part in your ability to concentrate for longer periods of time. I myself start to suffer from headaches in the office if i have concentrated for a prolonged period of time on something and I am convinced it is down to the lighting in the office as this does not happen to me when I work on my home computer. The key is to take regular breaks to try and prevent wearing yourself out. I find it is quite limiting what you can do in these circumstances. I too feel your pain."
789,"I'm afraid the options are limited and the limitations depends on your physical work environment and what the company you work for are willing to do. I'd say the solutions I've seen are a combination of these: Create a ""Do not disturb"" time. The idea is to set aside a certain time, like 14:00 - 17:00, where no interruptions are allowed. Phones are turned off, email clients are shut down and a ""Do not disturb"" sign is hung in the hall/door. 
If a question comes up that needed discussion, it should be taken to a separate room. This gives the advantages of a team sitting together in the same room, but at the same time you've got a chance to get into that important workflow. This is one of the pieces of advice Sven Peters from Atlassian gave in his ""7 things that make good teams great"" presentation . Get everyone who wants it their own office.
This usually isn't feasible at all due to the space it requires. Put people who must talk a lot (sales, marketing, support, bosses,...) in their own office. 
This is pretty standard, but leaves those who sometimes need to talk at their desk stuck in an open office disturbing those who require a quiet work environment. Place those who are easily disturbed in their own office. 
Very difficult to handle since it will result in jealousy. Also requires that there are enough separate offices for all those who want them. Accept that sometimes you will be disturbed and resort to minimizing the noise. 
I'd say this is the usual scenario. Those who find any noise a distraction are given headphones, earplugs or other ways to reduce the distraction. Not optimal at all. Discuss with others who share the open office regarding how to handle noise. 
Set up rules that all agree on. Such as; phones always on vibrate, leave the room before answering phones, no discussions in the room at all. If you all agree on what is allowed and not, it will be easier to follow them. This could evolve into have different open office room. One for those who are very easily disturbed and another one for those who don't aren't as bothered. There are several ambient noise generators, such as noisli that create a background noise which may help you focus. Find a different company that has a different office environment and prioritizes differently. If you are looking for a ""silver bullet"" that will solve all issues I think you will be disappointed. I think that the best you will find are options 3, 6 and 5. If that isn't enough, you will need to consider 8."
790,"How to list contracting on resume. How do I list contracting on my resume? Specifically, I'm paid by company B (a staffing agency) to do work for company A. Company A is much more impressive than company B -- everyone locally will have heard of A and likely be at least mildly impressed. But they don't directly pay me -- they pay company B, who pay me. Company B also provides my benefits and so on. Is it appropriate to list company A and put my job title as ""contractor""? ETA: Specific concerns are a) taking up too much space detailing the situation (since in the US I'm told I can only have one page and I have a lot of skills), and b) letting potential employers know I've worked at a large, established company rather than giving them the impression I worked at a small startup (since the staffing agency has a name that sounds like it's in the industry I work in)"
791,"Unless you were brought in to be the manager and clean this stuff up, you are treading on some really thin ice here. It seems like every newbie has a better way of doing things, that is, until they try to apply their way to the particular problems at the new company. That's when they realize the reasons why it is how it is. Anyways, most people will probably view your complaints in the light that its just another know-it-all newbie. So, you can rock the boat and look like a hero, but most likely you will create strained working relationships and/or a reputation that will be hard to discard. IMO, you need to first demonstrate you are great at the job you were hired to do. Within the scope of doing your job, I am certain there will be opportunities for you to get your ideas out their as a natural part of doing your job. Once you get a few of your smaller ideas accepted and people begin to recognize that you have some good ideas then you will be in a better position to push bigger agendas. Another piece of advice, If you want to point out a problem you had better darned well have a solution. There's no quicker way to get people to learn to tune you out than being that guy who is constantly pointing out problems but never fixes any of them."
792,"If you are finding work for yourself or through recruitment agencies, I'd say list who you did the work for. However, if the staffing agency finds you the work and actually holds the contract with the ""more impressive"" company then that's a different situation. In that case I'd say that I was employed by the staffing agency (company A) and I worked at Company B, Company C, etc, for these times with these responsibilities. That way your prospective employer can contact the right HR department for the relevant references etc."
793,"On resumes, I usually list the contracting company first, then the client company second. For example, if I worked for ""Bob's Bodyshop"" as a contractor, and they placed me at ""Big Shiny Corp"", I usually put something like: 1/2011 to 12/2011 - Bob's Bodyshop / Big Shiny Corp. I know many folks say ""1 page!"" but I find that one cannot trim a resume to one page and get any meaningful details across. One of my friends uses a functional resume, and his is 8 pages long. Mine is chronological, and I try to keep mine to 3 pages. We are both in our 50s."
794,"How can I reduce the size of a long resume without hiding all my skills and experience?. I'm in the US and have 30 years of experience with a bunch of different companies, working in high-tech and the software industry. I have a lot of links, skills, and education which has pushed my resume to five pages in length. How can I reduce the length of my past experience, skills, and education without short changing my skills and accomplishments?"
795,"Try your best to get it down to two pages. I've reviewed quite a few resumes, and typically I'll look over the candidate's skills, education, and then a few of the most recent work experience entries.  Then, if it looks like he or she may have what we need, we'll just bring them in for an interview. Once you go back beyond a few jobs, I would start listing the entries as just a summary: list the company, years worked, and skills/technologies used.  I doubt very many developers / hiring managers will actually read the details of what you were doing at job X 15 years ago."
796,"This depends where in the world you are and what sort of job you are applying for. I understand that the ""one page resume"" is standard in the US, but in the UK or Australia for instance, two pages would be more often recommended, while in countries like Germany, or sectors such as U.S. academia, a full career history would be expected. (Thanks tehnyit & Jeff O ) Where a full CV isn't expected however, think of your resume or CV as being a summary of your full Curriculum vitae , tailored to each job application. Include the skills and experience which are relevant to the job you are applying for and omit anything which isn't relevant. If you are writing a CV to go on a careers search website, you have to think differently again. Include things which you want to work with now , but omit things which you don't want to work with. For instance, if you have 3 years of pick experience (an unusual skill these days), but don't want to go back to that time in your career again, leave your pick experience off your on-line CV. Mostly these on-line CVs are used to filter candidates by keywords, so if you don't want to be bugged by recruiters contacting you about jobs you aren't interested in, make sure you don't include those skills. Another aspect, as Sam Woods suggests, is the seniority of the position you're applying for. Even in the UK, I wouldn't expect an application for a summer job (intern) position to provide as long a CV as someone with 20 years experience, applying for a senior position. Ultimately, your resume/CV is your chance to sell yourself . Don't say that you have great communications skills , demonstrate it with your CV. I once interviewed a contractor with a CV which was approximately 16 page long. It appeared to list every project they'd ever worked on and it was double spaced, presumably to make it easier for me to make notes. 95% of those projects were wholly irrelevant to me - they could have trivially condensed their CV to two or pages, which would have at least got them an interview. Finally, keep a full CV up to date for reference, if you have all of the information you need to hand, it makes it much easier to copy and paste it to generate those highly effective tailored CVs ."
797,"While one page resume is not as important of late but you still should put the most important things within the first 2 pages at the most. Reason for that is that the hiring manager who is a very busy person in general should be able to glance at your resume and decide whether or not he/she should proceed with further evaluation.  From my dealings with some people it's helpful assume that the person on the receiving end has ADD. Secondly it is normally understood at least in the world of software development and IT in general that technologies used 5+ years ago may not be as relevant today so what you know now and what you can do now is more important, which may not be true for all industries but certainly true for some."
798,"I have that much experience as well and my resume is two pages. Generally you only should show the last ten years of experience. That experience is irrelevant to a hiring manager and just gets you put on the ""he's too old"" page.  Employers aren't really interested in more than that and showing more will get you a fast track into the age discrimination pile. Here's some advice about how I condensed my resume. In brief, page one is the most important page, it contains the contact information and the accomplishments that are most relevant to the job I'm applying for. Page two contains the skills list, work history and education with only a 2 sentence (at most) description of each job listed after all the important stuff is in the accomplishments on page one. The purpose of page two is for HR to verify my experience and education if they need to and to let the hiring manger see the types of organizations I've worked for. But page one is the page that gets the interviews.
Weed through those skills and get rid of any that you haven't used in the last 5 years (Unless they are specifically relevant to the job you are applying for) and any that you would cut off your arm rather than use again. Ditch any Objectives section. Those are just wasted space. You can consolidate multiple contracting jobs (if need be) into a general listing rather than 10 6 month job in a row. Something like Consultant 2005-2008 for ABC company, GEH Company, XYZ company.
  Performed... makes sure the skills are listed in was that takes up the least amount of room, a table rather than a line by line list. This list is mostly for key word searches anyway. I have rearranged mine so that the first Section is Accomplishments. That takes up a page and contains only the major things I have done that are relevant to the position I am applying for. You may need to have several versions of this. Make sure to use business terms and not just technical ones (At a senior level I would expect you to be thinking in business terms and not just technical ones, you can get away with just technical at lower levels but at the senior level this is what distinguishes you from the pack). However, don't ignore technical accomplishments, you want them to know that you know your stuff.  Quantify if possible.  Show performance improvement data, money saved, time saved, unhappy clients turned around, Major awards etc. If you are a presenter at a conferences or have written a book on the subject etc, it goes here. The second page has the skills list, a 1-2 line list of the jobs and the general duties (you can use more for the last two jobs.) Then my education. And remember you don't need to show further back than the last ten years. No one is interested in what you did 30 years ago no matter how proud of it you may personally be."
799,"Yes, I would call that too long. I always try and get my resume down to 1 page, although sometimes I have to settle for 2. If it's any longer, I think you can remove unimportant items. Some tips to shorten it: Remove experience that is unrelated to the job you're applying for. You don't need to list that you worked in marketing for X years if you're applying for an IT job. Remove old experience, or combine/summarize it in a single line Simplify your education. You should only need at most one line for each degree relevant to the job you're applying for. For example, you don't need to list that you're a certified lifeguard if you're applying for an IT position. Customize your resume for the job you're applying for. If you're applying to a JAVA job, be sure to give them a resume that highlights your Java skills and experience. If you're looking for an ASP.NET job, show your web experience and summarize/combine the rest. Don't forget, you can go over your skills/experience in more detail during the interview. Your resume is simply your ticket to getting the interview. Use it to highlight points that will lead to conversation topics during the interview where you can expand on your skills and experience, not to list everything about you and what you know. Some people don't even read the resume too closely until right before the interview, or view a longer resume as detrimential to a candidate, so a longer resume can actually do more harm than good."
800,"I'd try to trim it down to no more than 3 pages. I read a lot of resumes and I while I personally don't mind reading long ones, it gets tedious unless it's very well written and the content is enticing. That's harder to do the longer the resume gets. Let's say you have worked on 100 projects. Trying to tell me how all 100 of them relate to the post I am offering without redundancy is hard. Just pick and choose the ones that have the most impact and leave it at that. If not there might be a chance that I lose interest once I see the first ""repeat"" or unrelated content. BTW, short resumes demonstrate your ability in distilling and understanding what's REALLY important to the matter at hand. If you list 5 pages and not ALL of them are  stunning, it does more harm than good."
802,"I agree with @Tangurena's answer , for most contact jobs. One case I would also like to share is when you work contract to hire and you get hired. I have several of these on my resume and I show them like this: Big Well-Known CompanyA - Aug 2005-Jan 2008 (Aug 2005-Dec 2005 -
temporary hire working for Name of agency) This gets several points across: It shows the total time I worked for the well-known company, and it lets the employer know that I was a temp-to-hire and I got hired, and it makes sure the HR reference check into my employment dates won't conflict with what I said on my resume."
804,"It depends on who's reading. If you're applying for a job and are in competition against dozens of other potential candidats, 5 pages of info will work against your advantage. The recruiter usually need to go through a big pile of CV and will probably not bother reading yours. Or if they do, it won't be in details, and they'll inevitable go over vital information. In this case conciseness is best. Try as much as you can to make only the relevant parts of your career fit on one page, send it and hope for the best. However this is not the only situation in which you send your resume. I read many times that most position are filled by word of mouth (instead of anonymous CV browsing). A friend of a friend, an ex-coworker, a member of your local user group, ... Networking will get you interviews far more easier than posting your resume on an online job board or anything like that. In those case, premliminary contact has been made and the interviewer will be more likely to take her time reading your responsabilities at your last job or that super cool project you did in college. Finally, I'll just mention that 5 pages is too long, even for the ""word of mouth"" scenario. For the recruiter, 5 pages is a chore. That's not something you want to give her. You can go to 2, maybe 3 if that's necessary. However, I like keeping some (little less relevant but equally awesome) experiences off my resume so I can ""casually"" mention them during the interview. You're much more than your resume says you are. Keep this in mind."
805,"My rule for a resume being submitted to a job application / recruiter is that it should be no longer than one standard-sized sheet of paper (US Letter in the US, A4 pretty much everywhere else), double-sided. The front is me, my contact information, my skills (in order of strength and relevance to the job), and my current employer position/job summary. The back lists my work history, education, relevant personal interests (e.g. I maintain some ports for the FreeBSD Project - that's relevant when applying for system administrator work), and a note that references are available on request. This resume, plus a tailored cover letter addressing why I want to work for $_COMPANY and why I think I'd be a good fit, should be enough to decide if they want to interview me or request more information about some specific skill or previous job. As someone who has to review resumes I have a strong preference for the brevity of this format: It tells me what I need to know to decide if I want to interview you.  If you bring a longer resume with you to the interview I don't mind it, particularly if you are calling out relevant positions/experience/skills in greater detail -- It shows a level of preparedness and respect for the interview process. Generally the absolute limit I'm willing to deal with are two double-sided pages.  The person submitting such a resume should have substantial experience (>15 years), and should be listing some big players in the field on their resume, with an impressive list of accomplishments (if your resume has grown to two pages and you're still listing ""Summer job cutting lawns"" there's something seriously wrong)."
806,"I have been consulting for 20 years so my resume is probably similar to yours.  I put things on my resume that make me look like a good candidate for the specific position I am applying for.  I format my resume like so: Skills These are skills that apply to the position I am seeking.  I include my evaluation  of experience level (Experience, Advanced, Expert) for each skill and group skills that naturally go together.  I only list the skills that are important to the job and are not general skills.  Why would I list my ability to use MS Office?  If it is listed in the job requirements then I will include it but otherwise, why bother? Degree and Certification I have 20 years of experience - I list my degree and certifications.  What my GPA, major, minor, any other crap about college is no longer important.  So BS in CS from SIU is fine.  Certifications I got in 2000 but are not current are irrelevant.  I do not want to talk about my NT4.0 MCSE to any employer so why would I list it? My most recent jobs and responsibilities - I include a small summary of projects I worked on and any thing that seems to apply to the position I am applying for. A condensed list of older jobs Generally the employer and position.  I only list major engagements here.  And condense smaller gigs I worked for a single consultant company into on job.  That I had work is important.  Beyond consultant programmer no one really cares what I did there.  If they do they ask."
808,"I'm a manager and I do quite a bit of interviewing.  I will only print out and read your first two pages (double sided, one page of dead tree).  Anything beyond that is probably wasting my time. If you couldn't summarize your relevant skills in two pages, you'll probably have trouble  writing succinct and accurate reports, emails, bug reports, code comments, design specs, etc. If you want to list lots of companies, go ahead.  Just give a one-liner for each. Save a tree, and my time."
810,"I'm not going to argue what's right or wrong, but the fact of the matter is that using pirated software is illegal. You should NEVER do something illegal on your job, no matter if it's OK by your boss (even if he/she explicitly tells you to). If your company won't supply you with the software you need to perform your assigned duties, then that's not your problem."
814,"It is my position that the resume is a short description of your work experience. I try to put about 1 paragraph's worth of detail for each job, and since I've worked for some companies for 10 years, and others for 3 months, a paragraph for each 3-6 month contract assignment in the past 3 years will quickly fill a page. If you are a contractor, and have contracted for the past 15 years, you will easily be able to fill 5 pages with a short synopsis of each assignment. I was an FTE for the first 17 years of my working career and it was hard to fill a single page of a resume back then - the subsequent 2 years were full of contract jobs and they'd fill up a single page just by themselves. The bottom line is that the single page rule was customary in an era where many people were able to get one job out of school and work there for the rest of their working career; or folks who only stayed 5 years at a job were considered ""job hoppers"". Today, you are likely to have many totally different careers during your working life and many different jobs. A resume that reflects the new realities of the workplace requires far more than the traditional 1 pager."
815,"I'm a manager who reads resumes from time to time and 5 pages is too long. The important thing to remember is that your resume is a brochure, not your autobiography. The sole purpose is to intrigue the hiring manager enough to want to talk to you in person not list every single accomplishment in your entire career. You can probably shorten it up some by mentioning a few examples of accomplishments and making it clear that they are just a few examples of many. Another technique is to put the more comprehensive version (project summaries, commendations, etc.) on a website and put a URL in the resume in case the hiring manager wants to investigate more deeply. When I am reading resumes I want a very succinct document that answers these basic questions in roughly this order: What are your major differentiators that make you a stronger candidate than the next guy? What are your key skills? How much experience do you have that is relevant to the position? (previous similar jobs) What qualifications do you have beyond experience (certifications, education, etc.)? How good are your written communication skills as demonstrated by this resume? I fully expect that a resume won't tell the complete story. That's what interviews are for. Don't stress over squeezing in every detail of every job you've ever worked."
816,"In the US, when I have worked for contracting companies, they tend to dislike giving their competition credit.  For that, I list the company where I did the work, my title and append "" - Consultant"".  HR understands what that means usually.  And as long as you make it clear you were working as a consultant (contractor, external, whatever their title for outside contractors is), few companies are going to care. This is often different in Europe, or anywhere they prefer a more accurate CV.  On a CV always list the company you actually employed by."
818,"All of the ideas before this one make setting time aside far more complicated than it needs to be. 20% is one day of any week. This way four days are spent working on ""normal"" projects. One day per week for four weeks are spent on ""other"" more inspirational work. Try this process on for size. Sounds like the idea has been sold to the higher-ups. If so, there is no work to do there. If you want to implement the project, do it on a 20% basis of one day per week. On the fifth day of the period (4 Fridays in a row, on the 5th Friday) Present the work. Sixth Friday, select the most awesome project. Add it to a refinement queue. Next four Fridays work around developing the project, decide if the project has true merit. If so, add it to the primary work schedule as a project and work toward an alpha version. Demonstrate the Alpha, and decide if you want to go any further. Keep list of other less worthy projects available for consideration. Likely the runner-up to the chosen project may get the same attention. If the project is chosen for further development, add it to the development queue. Wait one month for project to stabilize, rinse and repeat You should be able to do this at least four times a year. ""Failures"" meaning projects aside from the first 8 chosen can always be reviewed and revised again later."
819,I do a very simple sub list under the consulting/contracting company that I work for and limit it to 1-3 bullet points of highlights about what I did for the client. Two important things to remember to protect yourself: Make sure to lay out your resume so that it's clear that you were a contractor and not employed by the clients. You don't want anyone claiming you lied on your resume. Get permission to list clients on your resume! Some contracting companies have rules about not publicly disclosing clients or clients contracts might have provisions restricting you from saying you did contract work for them.
820,"How do I convince a manager to not ""meddle"" with the network?. We have a boss who used to be a member of the team, and still (perhaps too much) enjoys getting his hands dirty with the technical aspects. We're trying to move away from the old methods of doing everything by hand and automate and standardize the processes. However, the boss still likes to get in there and make changes and feels empowered to continue doing so since he is, in fact, the boss. I don't feel this is good for the organization in the long term since it creates more work and confusion as our team continues to grow, but how can I dissuade the boss from making out of band changes?"
821,"Think of your audience. They want to know what you're capable of with the least amount of effort. The sooner you get to a selling point, and the easier those selling points are to find, the better. I typically condense irrelevant work experience to a single line or make a one-line ""details below"" reference to it to preserve chronology (so people don't think you have large gaps in your work history) and move details to the bottom. Likewise with skills, avoid distracting from your strengths by diluting them with skills that at best you've only touched on. I tend to create a subcategory of ""exposed-to/entry level at best"" skills at the bottom of a skills listing. If there is stuff you know everybody adds to their resumes in your field, keep your own mention of things either very brief or non-existent if it's stuff that just comes with the territory of your other skillsets. For instance, I do client-side web development. Everybody is standards/aware/standards-compliant. One brief mention somewhere to make it clear you're aware that such things matter is more than enough but I've looked at more than a few resumes that break it into multiple bullet points which is a waste of space. Adding less relevant or redundant stuff for quantity is a mistake. If you're honest and forthcoming about what you're good at and what you aren't, it saves everybody time and employers appreciate it when you cut the bull. I would expect this to be a fairly universal phenomenon but I've had a lot of positive comments on my resumes in the US. Five pages is probably unnecessary (and paper isn't cheap), but the important thing is that they get to a good estimation of your relevant skills and experience by skimming pages one and two, and if you're lucky page three when they become interested. So it's not about length, it's about how quickly you get to the stuff that matters to them. And don't be afraid to monkey around with resume protocol a little bit by doing things like getting irrelevant stuff out of the way. They're looking for somebody to solve a problem, not somebody to sic the resume police on. If it's obvious you put in the effort to make your resume more relevance focused for a specific job, that's only going to make you look good."
822,"Does he breathe fire? Do people go to his office and never return? If not, tell him the team's trying to do something for big-win points and some of the changes he's been making have been undoing the stuff you're all working on. Now mind you, I can actually make fun of my boss's code and get away with it, so if you do work in an environment of terror and fear, do like all people do in such scenarios. Pass the buck. But you can probably talk to him without insulting him if you put some thought into it. Hint: Avoid the use of words like ""meddle"""
824,"I like what Erik said in one of his comments starting with the ""I'm confused..."".  One of the tricks I believe in dealing with bosses is making them feel like they make all the decisions, know everything and are the greatest bosses in the world (stroking their ego is what I like to think it is).  One of the tricks I use to do this is sometimes make myself seem like I don't know what is happening when I notice something ""I believe"" is wrong (it may NOT be). This is leading on from Eriks comments.  Sometimes I'll say things like: I'm struggling to grasp this code.  Can you talk me through it.
We have started implementing some processes that will help make our team more productive in the future. I'm not sure how this new code fits into that.  Can you talk me through it.
Is there any reasoning why you did this like this?  We have some similiar setups that we are working on that might make this easier to implement in the future. Sometimes we just have to put up with the ""interesting things"" that bosses do.  Some bosses find it hard to step away completely and really enjoy getting in there.  However they don't like to believe they are no longer required and sometimes don't want to show their inadequacies in case they feel the team might lose respect in their abilities. Basically, try and make your boss feel like the changes he did was really helpful but you don't quite understand how they fit into the direction that the boss and your team is trying to follow. If your boss has insecurities etc you may have to just be prepared to have to review all his code and try and fix/change them without his knowledge after he has made it. In the end, you can make suggestions and talk to your boss, but you can't change his way of working.  That is up to him and his bosses."
825,"My manager always seems too busy to meet with me. How can I improve that?. He's a great guy, but it feels like he's always in meetings or going to conferences or on the phone on long calls. He has told me that he really enjoys those interactions. He and I work somewhat different hours, though with a core set of overlapping hours in common. How can I improve our relationship and bring up issues that are slowing me down? 
There are some aspects of the work, the approach to take and the people that receive it that need to be discussed in a 'back-and-forth' manner, so the conversations we need to have are not suitable for emails."
826,"It's usually as simple as scheduling an appointment.  It might sound formal, but it's a lot easier for him to limit distractions when he can plan ahead for you.  Our team has a 15-minute meeting every morning, and my manager schedules one-on-one appointments with everyone every two weeks.  Between those two we cover 99% of our communication needs."
827,"For classical Job Shopping (contract Engineering), the standard has always been to list the dates and the client, with a notation to indicate that it was a contract position. For example, from my own resume: Jan 1984-Oct 1987 (Under Contract To) General Dynamics / Fort Worth
Division, Fort Worth TX. Some people will list the contract firm's name in parentheses, instead of saying ""under contract to"".  For example: Jan 1984-Oct 1987 (Global Group) General Dynamics / Fort Worth
Division, Fort Worth TX. or MAYBE something like: Jan 1984-Oct 1987  Global Group, Fort Worth Tx.  Under contract to
General Dynamics/Fort Worth Division. With this form, direct positions appear without the parenthetical note, viz. Mar 1983-Jan 1984  UTL Corporation, Dallas TX. Classical Job Shoppers are well-known for having short-to-medium gaps in their history, if they were between jobs.  This is considered perfectly normal for them.  (If you are in this category, and you run into a hiring manager or a recruiter who doesn't understand this, RUN AWAY!)  If you are a long-term employee of one firm, and they rent you out to various clients, and keep you on the payroll while you're ""on the beach"", you probably want to list them as your employer, and say something in the description about various assignments for various clients."
828,"Sometimes you need to give people's ego a way out.  Say something like, ""How did you want to integrate your changes with the new automation?""  Then hopefully he will initiate some questions about what problems it caused. However, I want to point out that the only person's behavior you have complete control over is your own.  Think about what you can do to mitigate the problem.  If your boss isn't the only one making manual changes, you either have process or training issues to work out, or the ease of making changes to the automation needs to be improved.  Maybe people were on board with the idea of automation, but not the implementation.  You need to figure out what specifically is keeping them from being fully on board now.  In the mean time, you can institute procedures like automatic audits to detect manual changes, and rollbacks to easily undo them."
829,"We're trying to move away from the old methods of doing everything by
  hand and automate and standardize the processes. But the boss still likes to get in there and make changes and feels
  empowered to continue doing so since he is, in fact, the boss. From what you're said it sounds like your boss is not totally on board with the automation/standardization process. If I'm right about that you absolutely must get your boss on board - have him in the loop and behind the drive toward automation/standardization, and hopefully he'll start doing things according to the appropriate processes. If you can't get your boss on board you may need to consider going over their head -- Explain to the next level of management how much time is being wasted ""cleaning up"" after the boss makes manual/out-of-band changes.  Preferably document negative effects (like a manual change that was wiped out during an automated push which caused an outage - totally avoidable if the new procedures were followed). Note that doing this may cost both you and your boss substantial political capital, and if it backfires you'll probably be the one taking serious heat :-)"
830,"Try to keep a fixed regular meetings rather than agenda. E.g. we do weekly project review or bi-weekly status meeting or something. And keep reminding him. this works better than specific agenda meetings because it sets the rhythm and he probably keep in mind that i need to dedicate time. Use calender as much as possible. So even if he doesn't honor the meeting actually, as number of instances of lost meetings grow, you will get some attention. Keep him posted - of all events, consequences. Many people (specially the busy ones) focus only to attend the top priority. So when you keep sending message they will respond automatically when they find it important enough. Don't wait for meeting to discuss to send out important message. Catch him for few minutes in corridors. Sometimes leaving them with a small agenda (puzzle in their minds) is enough to activate them rather than an elaborate meeting. What you should look forward is to bring his focus to the key issue leaving so many details. Don't fight to get more time. What do you need him for? If you need for decision making - you should put up the context right to him along with deadline. But if you need his time to learn new things or understand some processes or systems, find alternative sources for information. Sometimes bosses don't really have time for coaching everyone. Last but most important. Keep going on your own! 
Don't get bothered so much about getting appointment. Many of my team members feel what you said - i don't give them time. Sometimes, i just don't have to. I Know things are in control, i know people are doing their job well enough and i don't need to intervene unless something break; but they just feel disappointed not to find my time; rather they should have felt happy about being empowered.  [Judge him on this before you use this tip.]"
832,"A resume should be as short as possible. Having said that, your 5-pages CV is huge (no matter how much experience you have). I am an SW engineer with 12 years of experience, with several projects behind me. Once I received a resume of a 10 years experienced engineer. It was very long, and written in not to easily understand language. After the first page I gave up. So, I would recommend you to have two versions of CV : one short condensed (shouldn't be longer then 2 pages), and another long with all details."
834,"I am in a similar situation after 15 years in software engineering. I don't want to trim down my CV because some of the stuff that I've done is still relevant (some isn't) and would still interest me if offered to do it again. Some people may be interested in how my career has progressed, and may also find something interesting that I've done a few years back. However, I can sympathize with the person reading my CV so I do the following: I put the most important facts on the first page (objectives, skills, expertise, education), The most recent job would also still be on the first page, I sometimes alter the first page to better present myself for the position I'm applying to I still need to remove from my CV the keywords that I get found on for jobs I don't want to do anymore (e.g. like ColdFusion that I did back in 1999 and don't want to go back to). Some recruitment agents ignore the fact that jobs you've done ten years ago paid half of what you may be being paid now and still feel the urge to send you similar jobs."
835,"Skype You can use this to keep in touch with staff and clients. You can do calls and conferences at no cost. Dropbox Share your files with staff or between your laptop and desktop. Google Docs / Google Calendar Share and update documents. Share and update calendars. Virtual office / address I use it as it is cheaper than hiring office space and I don't think P.O Box look professional, nor does a home address Just what I use to aid with the operations and organisation of working virtually! Hope it is of some help."
836,"I'd say you have several choices: Accept the culture and work within it (what most people do) Confront the culture This requires a lot of tact and patience and choosing the right time to bring things up. Change the culture Bring up publicly how long hours are detrimental in the long term and why they should not be done. Ignore the culture Set your own hours, announce them and stick to them consistently.  People will often find over time that consistency and reliably beat out 'long' hours... from employees who are less consistent in their times on a day-to-day basis. Start a new culture Come in early. This has been my techniques in many places.  Given that 'long hours' often really means ""staying late"", counter this by in coming early... and then you can leave (relative to others) early (or at a normal time).  This is good idea in office where there is pressure to not be 'first to leave' and you have a boss or co-workers that regularly leave late which would otherwise put a lot of pressure on you and others to do the same."
838,"My Open Office is not in increasing my productivity, how can I counter this?. Possible Duplicate: Are there any strategies you can use to remain focused when working in a open plan environment? We have an open office (no cubical walls) that is intended to increase productivity. However I find that the increase in distractions, both sound and visual negates this. How can I overcome those distractions but still keep in touch with colleagues in a (fairly) open manner?"
839,"IMHO this is related to the following equation: # pages ~ expected salary / # of candidates which basically mean, the more candidates there are and the lower the expected salary, the less time the recruiter will spend with your CV. So for a general position one page is enough. If you are applying as the next CEO you may certainly write 5 pages, or a book. Beside the joke I guess you get the picture. I work in IT and my CV is 5 pages long, with much space and easy to the eye. I'm sure I won't get the position if I have to compete with 100 others, but I know there are at most 10 other candidates and I'm ""out-of-the-box"", so it worked pretty well up to now. It's not bad to be different, if you are applying for a position that requires someone to be ""different"", on the contrary. But I know you already knew that :-)"
840,"Invite your manager for lunch or coffee , i.e. your treat.  Consider: Chances are they'll accept – even though there's really no such thing as a free lunch. You'll get face time to discuss some of what you're concerned with ... but don't make it all about work. Your manager may reciprocate and invite you to lunch another time."
841,"As other have noted, it depends on where and it depends upon what the game is. If you are in the break room and everyone else is engaged in non-work activities then you should be fine as long as you aren't playing a game that is likely to be controversial (i.e. Grand Theft Auto) or contains objectionable activities. Depending upon the industry that you are in, puzzle games might actually reflect somewhat positively as it shows that you have problem solving skills which can be desirable skills in an employee. Consider two employees reading a book, one is reading a non-fiction book about something that is mildly indirectly related to work while the other is reading a random fiction book, which do you think is going to look more impressive to an employer? In the event that someone does object to playing the game, I would say you need to be careful about how you address the game playing, but depending upon the type of game, you could point out others playing sudoku or doing a crossword puzzle and ask how that is different?"
842,"Boss management is in important work skill. The need to communicate a particular item through a face-to-face meeting can fall into three general categories: Urgent information he must know as soon as possible Things that need to be resolved today Things that can wait until a good time Each of these needs to be handled slightly differntly. If it can wait until he has some free time, simply send him a meeting request using the first available free moment you see in his calendar.  Make sure to specify the topic. If there is some infomation he needs to see in prepartion for the meeting attach it to the meeting request or send and email with the attchments or links to where the information can be found. Things that need to be resolved today require a bolder approach. First, know how you boss likes to communicate. When he is in meetings or on calls, does he read his emails or use IM? If so send him a quick note describing the situation and why it needs to be discussed today and asking him to make a time to squeeze you in. The magic words to use are: ""If this doesn't get resolved today, we may not be able to meet the deadline."" Do not however use those words unless they are true. No one listens to the boy who cried wolf. If he doesn't checks his emails or IM during a meeting, you may need to get a bit more creative about finding out when the meeting will end and conveniently being near the conference room when it does, so you can ask him when he can give you the time you need. Make sure to tell him how much time you need in your request. If I need only five minutes or less, my boss will often go to the next meeting just a little late. Finally there are genuinely urgent issues. These are typically only involving either issues concerning things already in production or upset clients. I make it a rule to never let my boss get blindsided by urgent issues that he hears about from someone higher in the organization than he is. So if he is on the phone, knock on his door anyway and go in and say, ""I'm sorry to disturb you but such and such has come up."" Sometimes I write those words down, so the call isn't disrupted if he is on speaker phone. I don't often know what his call is about or how urgent it is, so I then let him determine if the call or my issue is more critical. Normally my boss will either tell the call that something has come up that he has to deal with and set the meeting to be completed later or he tells me something like, ""This call will be done in five minutes, I'll come get you when I'm off."" In the second case, I leave until he can get back to me. Same thing if he is in a meeting. I will knock on the door, open it slightly and say, I need to talk to _ . Usually the manager then comes to the door and I tell him the problem and the urgency and he decides to leave the meeting or not. The key to this is not disrupting the meeting unless the issue is genuinely urgent. The server room is on fire is urgent. You have to leave right now because your spouse died is urgent. The CEO is going to want to talk to you about why client XYZ is upset as soon as you are free is usually urgent.  I need a decision on XYZ that isn't due to production for three weeks is not. If you are having trouble connecting well with your boss, it is possible that you and he have different ideas about the urgency of the issues you want to discuss with him. Perhaps you need to have a meeting to discuss how he would prefer to be contacted and what issues he would see as urgent enough to interrupt him."
843,"I do a decent amount of hiring for experienced tech talent. You don't get hired based on your resume, so you don't need everything you've done in it. The resume is your chance to get an interview, nothing more. So you want to showcase the best things about you, and a 5 page resume will only dilute that message and diminish you're chances of getting an interview. A 1 to 2 page max resume is what you want. Highlight the coolest things you've done, and showcase the qualities people look for in an employee such as work ethic, passion, etc. The interview is your place to elaborate on specifics, and what you couldn't fit in the resume. Good luck!"
844,"Why is a one to two page résumé recommended?. When I was getting my degree, we had a course about how to market yourself as a job seeker, and one thing our teacher had a strong opinion on was that your résumé should be no longer than two pages (I live in the US). I've seen this recommendation from many other places since then, such as hiring managers, human resource workers, career guidance counselors, etc. Why is it recommended that your resume be only one or two pages in length? I would prefer a comprehensive recommendation, along with some links to research backing up the reasons for this recommendation, if possible."
845,"Ever seen tl;dr on a forum? Same premise. Let's say that I'm an HR director. I have to fill a job for a widget-maker position. In come 100 résumés for the position – I'm going to look for any reason to get that number down to something manageable. If I see that everyone else felt they could qualify themselves in 1 page, what makes you think that I'm going to read through 3 or 4 pages to find out what makes you so special? If you want to increase your chances of being read, you have two pages: your cover letter, and a 1 page résumé. In your resume I want to see your previous work experience for the last 5 jobs or 10 years, I want to see your education, and I want to see your salary requirements all at a glance. I don't care about your hobbies, I don't care that you have a cat named fluffy that purrs when you call for her. I'm probably not going to read your nonsense objective; I'm probably not going to read about your awards and accolades. I'm skimming and I want to skim fast. I need you to be accurate, succinct, and qualified; you need me to read your résumé. That is reason enough.

846,"The answer is simple: It makes it easy to identify if you are a good fit The critical point to understand is that the resume is only a starting point of the recruitment process. When I select the resume to decide on the further evaluation process, I am only looking for whether you fit the profile. So from that perspective, I should focus simply to highlight why you are a good fit. Irrespective of the quality and beauty of your resume, this is not a final boarding pass to land you the job - so it must focus on only most essential stuff. If you do treat the resume as a selling point - even then highlight the most important aspect that defines who you are rather than just say everything. No one needs a full biography of you if you are not the right fit."
847,"How to Deal With Unreasonable Expectations?. My boss is asking for unreasonable levels of productivity from me. Our product is a lower quality than the majority of other products in this area, and the owner isn't willing to go through the expense to upgrade our product. I've compiled and delivered a collection of ways we could improve our results, but unfortunately my position and authority prohibit me from acting on them. How can one meet or handle employer expectations when they're not given the tools and resources to do so?"
848,"Let me add another perspective. I was once told by a recruiter that a potential employer said I was not the kind of person that they would want at a company because of things I said online. Considering what they found, I would lean towards the employer being a bit to sensitive for my tastes. Then again, the employer could have been overly cautious, and had he not discovered what I said, I might have done well there. The point is, there is a lot about me other then my skills for the job in question you might like or dislike me for. Some of it you can't legally ask for, and some of it might just be stuff you never thought to ask. For example, I might raise and slaughter dogs for meat (I don't btw and that might be illegal). If one of my extra circular activities really bothers you, I'd much rather you be able to find out about that on your own, and for you to tell me I'm a bad fit."
849,"I think that your boss to some extent is relying on ""good luck charms"" like his name to promote his real estate.  So it may be possible to take somewhat entrepreneurial approach to the problem and attempt the following: Approach your boss with the proposition of investing $X into your attempt to bring business his way which basically means you are taking the risk of losing $X and likely your job with it but potentially increasing the business your boss will receive from your actions. As you have mentioned, your boss expects improved levels of productivity from you but is not taking actions (in terms of going through the expense or/and others) to practically achieve it. It means he is, to a certain extent, ready to execute a new and innovated strategy that can serve the purpose but is insecure about whether or not things would pan out the way he wants. Since you have already compiled a collection of ways to improve results, it is the right time to gently convince your boss to overcome his fear and give practical touch to what you have to suggest. You people will be able to actually do it only when you come out of this working-on-the-same-thing-and-expecting-different-results attitude. Best!"
852,"Well unreasonable is in the eye of the beholder. As long as you persist in believing the task is impossible, it will be. AS I see it, you have two choices, move to one of the competitors who has a better product or take this up as a challenge to show how really good you are. Of course the competitors may not be interested if you are shoing a poor track record at a bad place to work, so really option 2 is your best bet. So you know you can't spend money and you know that some things you want to change aren't going to change. So then you get creative. There must be nontraditonal ways to market the product. You might even be able to do an analysis to prove why you should change some things and suggest possibly changing in a small batch to see if it works. The reason why most people fail to get their suggestions implemented has more to do with how they present them to management than the actual merits of the suggestion. Management wants things defined in business terms and they want suggestions where the numbers have been crunched to show how much money they will save or additonal money they will make if the suggestion is taken. They also want to reduce risk. You need to quantify these things. Going to the boss and saying, this isn't working I want to do this instead just won't cut it. Going to the boss with the actual performance of the current vendor for the last two years and the actual performance of other vendors for similar work for other clients in a direct comparision is much more compelling.  This question orginally talked about rental agents, so I'll give an example based on that. Suppose the current agent has gotten you a 30% occupancy rate. Go to other agents and ask what occupancy rates they have gotten for similar classes of property. Suppose you find one has a 45% occupancy rate and another has a 60% occupancy rate. And further the last guy takes a smaller commission. Now you have the numbers to convince the boss. To reduce risk, you might propose moving to the other agent in increments, make him prove he can get better occupancy rates by giving him the worst properties you have. Not only we he try harder to fill them to get the rest of the business, but the competition might wake up the first guy yo his potential loss of business and he may try harder. You might also talk to the boss and see if there are some things he thinks you should do that you currently are not doing."
853,"You need to sit down with your boss and respectfully show him why it is not possible to bring productivity levels up to what he wants, and talk over proposals that can be implemented to bring productivity up to the desired level. To begin, gather your information and figure out exactly what you want to say. You'll want a clear way to show him that his productivity standards cannot be met with your current resources. I don't know your specific situation, however do your best to be objective as possible, and don't get personal. Don't say things like ""you won't let me do this"" or ""I'm not allowed to do this"", but instead phrase it such that ""I feel that because we are limited to this..."". This makes you sound less aggressive so won't put him on the defensive, and puts the two of you on the same side (that of making money) You'll also want to figure out a good way to present your suggestions to improve productivity. If possible provide some actual numbers of the sort of productivity increase your suggestions will cause. Saying ""I'd be able to do much better if we implement X"" isn't nearly as powerful as saying ""if we implement X we could increase our productivity by Y%, and that would pay for itself in Z years"" Once you figure out what you want to discuss with your boss and how you want to approach it, set up a time to talk with him/her. I usually suggest this anytime you want to discuss possible changes with someone higher in the hierarchy than yourself. Don't just ""ambush"" them with your proposals, but instead set up a time to sit down and talk them over. Be sure they know in advance what you want to talk about so they won't be caught by surprise and have time to prepare if they want to Most reasonable employers are very interested in increasing their productivity and profits, and are happy to talk with their employees about how they can do that. If your boss still isn't interested in changing anything, then perhaps it is time to start looking for another job."
854,"I have interviewed when I have been faced with over 1000 resumes. Interviewing is not my full-time job. Any time I spend reading resumes either takes away from the tasks that are my full-time job or cuts into my personal time. Why would I want to weed through resumes longer than 1-2 pages? Why would someone looking for a job want to annoy the person doing the hiring? A resume is a sales brochure, not a biography. And if you have less than five years of experience, you had better not have more than one page. I remember vividly one fellow who sent us a ten-page resume when he had only two years of experience. We passed that one around the office and laughed at it, but we didn't interview him. In general, you only have a few seconds to catch the interest of someone reading your resume. A long one tends to make someone not feel at all interested in someone who can't even follow basic directions that are widely known about how long a resume should be."
855,"This answer is written from the POV of a private sector US company. Practices in the government and other countries are often different. For most technical positions two pages is plenty.  Please try and put yourself in the shoes of the person who is given a stack of over a hundred or more resumes and told to pull out the best prospects. With the best will in the world your reviewer is very likely to find a long resume to be off-putting.  Two pages is enough to substantiate your basic qualifications, experience, and strongest skill sets. All you are trying to do is get your resume moved from the reviewer's inbox to the 'contact for more information' box. If you have decades of experience and an impressive CV, then you still want to present a resume of no more than two pages covering the highlights of your career. You can then attach your full CV listing all your publications, awards, and inventions. This is true even if the hiring company solicited a resume from you based on your reputation.  If you are being considered for a very senior position then the reviewing senior executives will appreciate your two page 'executive summary' that precedes your full CV. If the hiring executive for this hypothetical senior position doesn't already know all about you he or she will ask the HR to verify the details in your long CV."
856,"I can provide a little information on this based around how my company has implemented it and how we have struggled. At my company we implemented it as a recruiting tool and as a way to keep engineers skills sharp. There are also some potentially interesting reasons to keep utilization from getting too high to better facilitate context switching.  That answer also has several good guidelines around 20% time and some additional references that further support his point. We are not basing what we do around the points mentioned there, but I do think it is worth reflecting on if you are trying to implement  your own 20% time at a company. We have a few basic guidelines around what people's 20% time can be used for.  It should be something that generally contributes to the company (including to the culture we are trying to build) or to your own professional development.  So spending time learning a new programming language is awesome, using the time to learn guitar is not. We also hold regular presentations, and if you are taking the time then you need to also give a presentation as to what you were working on.  This keeps the 20% time productive. Some things we have found 20% time especially good for: Prototyping ideas or playing with technologies we aren't yet ready to put into production. Keeping skills sharp. Recruiting great people. Provide an opportunity for engineering to build effective proofs of concept that can get product-level support. As far as allocation, we've tried several different things. Time Per Week The idea here is that 1 day a week is dedicated to side projects. Essentially the ""if you're allocating 20% to a Friday every week"" approach to the problem. We tried this implementation first, and ran into several immediate problems: Many interesting challenges are not conducive to working on for one day.  It takes that long just to familiarize yourself with what you are doing. If you were running even slightly behind on any given task, you didn't take it… which frequently meant that you never took 20% time. Rolling over was problematic, because frankly, if you are tracking it with a time sheet at that level something has gone wrong. Not very predictable from a planning standpoint, because while Fridays were common they weren't universal, and you didn't know who would be taking it or whether they would actually take it. It did help more with planning, because it helped prevent people from putting their personal velocity too high if they put in an automatic 20% buffer. For the most part, it never got used. One Iteration Out of Five We worked for a long time off of two week iterations.  So the next implementation of the idea was that you would spend one iteration out of every five working on whatever side projects.   This worked reasonably well–substantially better than the previous version.  Some considerations: This made things very predictable from a product standpoint.  You knew exactly what weeks you would lose and could schedule around that accordingly. On the other hand, scheduling conflicts were common because a team would be scheduled for a release the week after and need to get mock deployments or last-minute testing done. So they would frequently find their schedule moving around, and they could easily disrupt someone else's 20% time because of the need for their expertise on the deploy or the code. It didn't really help with the utilization problem. Teams that didn't have perfectly synced iterations (none of us did) couldn't really effectively work together on larger or more interesting projects. One Week Out of Five Then we started moving to a kanban system and started thinking in weeks instead of iterations, so we transitioned between 1 iteration out of five to one week out of five. Conflicts with deployments were more common (frequency), but generally generated lower impact since it was easier to block off a week than it was to block off two weeks. Since everyone was working week-by-week, it made it easier to sync up with other teams. Other than that it was very similar to one iteration out of five. Time blocks per quarter This is the current system that we are trying.  The idea here is that you set up tasks for yourself on the kanban boards with the amount of time allocated to them that you get for the quarter. Time does not roll between quarters, but you can take it all up front or all at the end, or in smaller chunks as you see fit.  This lets individuals and teams figure out what would work best for them based on their release schedule, and also to take time in more or less than a one week increment depending on their schedule, what they are trying to do, etc. This solves a lot of the problems we encountered before, but it has the disadvantage that time has to be more closely managed and is harder to precisely predict. On the other hand, it can be had at a lower level of disruption."
857,"What steps can I take to avoid having potential employers take a position of high responsibility less seriously because it was reached quickly?. This question's hopefully less close-able cousin. What steps can I take to avoid having future potential employers take a position of high responsibility less seriously because I reached it quickly? Quickly meaning in less than a year, and high responsibility meaning beyond the scope of the job at many similar organizations. I work in the legal industry. My situation (without going into too many specifics) is that I have been given a lot of responsibility at my current workplace and perform many tasks that would ordinarily fall to someone with a specialized degree. I am expecting to stay here for a year or two in total before moving to a different city. This kind of turnover is not unusual in my organization, and is even encouraged, but I know that's very much not the case at most other similar institutions. I'm concerned that the short amount of time I'll have worked this job will end up devaluing the experience I have gained and that my successes here will appear less legitimate to potential employers going forward. How can I avoid this (either by language I can use in my resume/cover letter or things I can say in an interview)?"
858,"Humor and Patience. That is, wait a while.  Maybe some weeks.  Then when things are relaxed mention it in a group setting as a joke, e.g. 'Yeah, well we all know what happens when we [follow bad practice x], from when we saw effect y right... ha ha'.  Note you're not even mentioning the persons name, but ina group setting folk have a chance to agree or refute you."
859,"You have a tough job in your hand. And as far as i understand there isn't straight forward way to go! But change you need. And it can only be through a tough perseverance you can get. Get them to reality. I think they do understand the reality, but just that they don't want to accept it. Simple ways are to stick to detailed data, charts and so on. Stick to that as much as possible from authentic sources rather than your own perception. Only when you continuously supply the relevant data they will come to know. Stop fighting to improve quality. Most often, when it is known that there is no feasibility for additional investments - people don't quite admit problem, instead they try to push other way. What they really want may be is how to maximize quality out of what we have (a legitimate and better management objective) than how to get to the next level where business is easier to do. Always bring up issues in open forum - objectively and agenda by agenda. When you want to be a change - you cann't really bring everything turn around in one day. Start winning small battle one at a time. Object on specific points and prove your point only in that scope. Slowly, people will begin to appreciate. Cut across the cynicism. When you know something is wrong - look for what should have been a better way to do it and how to improve it than just duck out by putting blame and move on! Most of the time other side refuses to accept simply because they are only avoiding the blame part of it. Do something innovative. So many management books will write about innovation - but when the real life gives us opportunity we all look down upon. May be now you will say ""innovation in our industry? not possible!"" But that's where you are wrong. Just take a break and make consciously think something unusual. Some of the first ideas will go very bad straight - but if you keep up the thinking you will finally hit somewhere."
860,"If legitimacy is the only thing you are worried about, go get some referrals from clients that can back it up. As for time spent, as long as you aren't seen as being a chronic job hopper it really shouldn't be an issue. If it's 2 or 3 in a row where you haven't put in at least a couple of years it might look bad but then that depends on the industry as well."
861,"Speaking as a former teacher of undergraduate professional and technical writing courses, in which one of the units was to create an employment portfolio including a resume, some of the reasons for teaching the students to create a 1-page resume are: to help students understand the very real situation in which they are one of many applicants, and the person reviewing the resume will spend very little time reviewing theirs to help students understand how to make rhetorical decisions about what to include and what not to include (because of the first point) to help students learn to write concise, action-oriented descriptive phrases about their skills and experience (also because of the first point) In other words, ensuring students are not wasting a recruiter's time with fluff, at the point in time when fluff might be all they have. But these guidelines for entry-level job seekers tie in to the general advice given in the Monster.com link used by another respondent, ""The One-Page Resume vs. the Two-Page Resume"" , which focuses on understanding the short attention span of reviewers and showing the most recent and relevant accomplishments, among other things. The guidance given to undergrads, that you and probably many others were given, is not materially different than the guidance we get as experienced, working adults, in which we must understand the context in which we are applying (e.g. is it a cattle-call job in which first, quick, impressions matter most, or a more specialized advanced position in which greater detail is both desired and beneficial?) and tailor our resume to both the position itself and that context .  This means making informed rhetorical choices which in the end may result in the use of a resume longer than 1-2 pages . In some cases, that's just fine; I always suggest having two resumes in your back pocket: one made for a recruiter's easy scanning of skills and experience in the last 7-10 years (if you've been a working professional that long, and if the jobs in that timeframe are relevant to the job  you're applying to now), and one to send to the recruiter and the hiring manager after you've made it to the ""let's talk more"" stage and giving a richer and more detailed picture of yourself is appropriate."
862,"I have experience working in organizations that implemented something like ""20% time"" (even if it was just ""10% time"") and it's something that I am going to be implementing in the company I just joined. The answer to the question of how is ""carefully"".  That's not meant to be a snarky response, but rather a true one to a broad question in which we don't know the details of your company.  By ""carefully"" I mean: with support from superiors, or at least a tacit understanding of what's going on with consistency (don't implement the program and then take it away immediately) by giving support to those attempting it (don't denigrate the work product, and celebrate the output) with an understanding that in the beginning you might see less direct benefit (or outputs) for the projects to which people are officially assigned This leads to the question you didn't actually ask, which is why do this in the first place ?  Understanding the ""why"" behind this will make these following answers to your sub-questions make more sense. What are the boundaries for that 20% of time? Whatever you want, that in some way enhances the company's products or its resources (e.g. you). What happens if I have to work 40hours to complete my project on time? (etc) If you don't have time to spend on something extra, don't. If you look at the first line of the NY Times article to which you linked, it says ""Engineers are encouraged to take 20 percent of their time to work on something company-related that interests them personally.""  Emphasis mine. Encouraged.  Not forced.  ""20% time"" is not about ""mandatory fun"" or ""extra work beyond your actual assignment"".  It is voluntary, and it's about discovering and encouraging motivation in the workplace. It's worth noting that it's not something that Google invented -- the sticky note came about in the early 1970s because a 3M employee used his ""15% time"" to dream it up . Daniel Pink, author of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us focuses discussion about employee motivation on three factors: the need for autonomy (desire to direct our own lives), mastery (the desire to get better at something that matters), and many examples of ""20% time"" or Atlassian's FedEx Days , which are 1.5 day events meant to foster creativity, scratch itches, get traction for radical ideas and (in the end) have fun, have at their core the desire to make happier, more motivated, and engaged employees with the understanding that the investment will pay off in better work during the other 80% of the time, if those are the things that work for you . Back to the original question of ""how does a company do this""? I return to my answer of ""carefully"", but would also add ""with gusto!"""
863,"My advice for any area that you're not comfortable in and/or you think may be perceived as a potential weakness is to be very honest about it and address it up front. If you think it may be an issue, some employers may too.  Or it may be a topic you will seem to feel 'sensitive' about in an interview.  So in your resume and/or your interview I would indicate that, although this was a rapid climb 'in position', you proved your work in it by doing a, b and c and was able to work well with the other folks at that level and make major contributions at that level (again, specify the 'senior level' contributions. That's what folks are really interested in and by addressing a potential or perceived weakness up front you can neutralize it or even turn it to your advantage. You can also say why you had the rapid climb.  Did you seek it or were you sought out based on the work you had already done... It's also a great chance to see in an interview ""wow, it was a big challenge for me and I was pretty nervous about it, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed it"" which pretty much covers; enthusiasm, ability to change, honesty, humbleness, openness...  Boom You're hired! ;)  Well anyway it helps."
864,"Our product is a lower quality than the majority of other products in this area, and the owner isn't willing to go through the expense to upgrade our product. At a previous job, our branch office's software had a huge profit margin (about 60%) and our main product had about 60% of the market (for that product). As a result, corporate decided that our cash cow was going to subsidize the entire division (no other branch had a profit margin over 10%, and several were losing money). This resulted in our branch having zero money nor time to make upgrades nor hire additional staff. Nor were we allowed to make any significant changes. The cash-cow milking was a directive which came down from the CEO and that sort of ""penny wise and dollar foolish"" was what got the CEO fired last year. I got tired and quit about 18 months ago and a recent chat with the boss, he had mentioned that the profit margin has dropped to about 30% and market share is down to about 40%. Many of the larger customers had been leaving for competitors products and the smallest customers had left to use a free website set up by the government. I've compiled and delivered a collection of ways we could improve our results, but unfortunately my position and authority prohibit me from acting on them. I did this at a previous job and was dinged badly on my performance review one year for doing so. I was able to make some small and minor changes in our development process but those drove my boss crazy. That boss is trying to get me to come back and save their bacon, and of the folks who quit in the past 2 years (the other guys who quit had been there 10 +/- 2 years), some will never come back, one is already back and the boss is balking at trying to match what I'm making now. The new CEO has made some changes in policies - and these new policies have the potential to make things turn around. Simple things like a wiki (to keep track of developer knowledge) and setting up a build machine (to make builds repeatable) are well within the ability to do them as evenings and weekends projects and then present them as fait accompli . I had been there for 5 years and I was the short timer - everyone else had been there for 8-18 years. All of the business and domain knowledge was trapped in people's heads and there wasn't a way to store it to preserve it; when several key developers quit in the past 2 years , a huge amount of that knowledge was irretrievably lost. There are some studies on the conflict between status-seeking bosses and employees who want to help improve things, one of which is Reversing the Extroverted Leadership Advantage: the Role of Employee Proactivity . From the study: Researchers have frequently observed that employees’ proactive behaviors can be threatening to leaders, as they have the potential to introduce unwelcome changes and We thus propose that when employees are proactive, more extraverted leaders will respond less receptively to ideas and suggestions. In turn, perceiving a lack of leader receptiveness will discourage employees from working hard on behalf of their leaders. One of the things the researchers were mentioning was that to extroverted leaders, employees who came up with lots of ideas were seen as threatening the leader's dominance. This leads to a conflict in both status and power. We thus predict that the combination of extraverted leadership and employee proactivity has the potential to create a power struggle, as both leaders and employees seek to gain control and exercise influence. To do so, extraverted leaders may dismiss employees’ proactive behaviors or work harder to increase their own control and influence, focusing on claiming status and asserting their authority instead of facilitating effective group performance. Indeed, research suggests that seeking dominance and power is likely to discourage leaders from considering employees’ perspectives (Galinsky, Magee, Inesi, & Gruenfeld, 2006). Employees, in turn, are likely to feel rejected and slighted by leaders’ lack of consideration for their ideas (McFarlin & Sweeney, 1996), leading them to experience helplessness and powerlessness (Magee & Galinsky, 2008). I'm going out on a limb and suggest that what is an effective management style for low-creativity professions (such as call centers or fast food franchises) is a counterproductive one in high-creativity professions (such as software development). The authors of the linked study seem to agree: When does extraverted leadership contribute to higher group performance? In both a field and a laboratory study, we found that when employees were not proactive, extraverted leadership was associated with higher group performance. However, when employees were proactive, this pattern reversed, so that extraverted leadership was associated with lower group performance."
865,"When is it appropriate to work during a meeting?. When in a meeting, there are often little things that come up in the meeting that could just be done during the meeting, instead of recording actions, doing it after and the reporting back at the next meeting. I am not talking about working on other projects, checking email, or generally working during a meeting, but instead am talking about immediately addressing issues that are mentioned during the meeting itself. Is this a good philosophy, or are there problems with it? Perhaps, it would have to be subjective to the culture of the company, content of the meeting, amount of people in the meeting, type of meeting {presentation/discussion}, and other factors? Perhaps the answer is not a yes or no, to the question, but rather some insight into such factors. An example (which obviously tend to favor an affirmative answer): Getting some more information to clarify an unexpected question raised during the meeting (from database, CRM, Google)"
866,"I would say no, it makes the meeting too fragmented. If there's a lot of topics that are completely irrelevant to you then it's a sign that either you shouldn't be there, or the meeting agenda should be changed (reduced) to only cover items that all participants need to be there for. Some of the problems it raises are: can generate a lack of respect; can lead to 'double' explanations when it turns out the item was relevant;  increases distraction when device clicks, beeps, vibrates, etc."
867,"What role does the phone screener play in the hiring process at large companies?. I recently had a phone screen for one of the ""big"" tech companies.  I know that I should think of the interview process as a bit of a ""black box"" and just try to do my best, but I can't help but be curious. Does the phone screener simply give a pass/no pass answer to HR?  That is, is my fate entirely in that person's hands? Or, is there some discussion between the screener and others involved in the hire about the questions and my answers?  Is there any kind of objective measurement, or does it all depend on the ""vibe"" or general impression of the screener?"
868,"While I agree that the whole ""exempt from overtime"" notion is of no benefit to employees, in the end, your work situation is still largely what you make it. What I've done in this kind of situation (which is not exactly what your question is asking, but I'll go with it anyway), was just count my hours and make sure they added to a more or less normal work-week. If I did overtime, I'd do shorter time next week when I particularly wanted to leave early, or take a day off and not formally report it at all (i.e. email my team that I wouldn't be in because I wasn't feeling well or just because I worked all weekend and needed some rest, and didn't call/email HR to tell them I was taking a sickday) - with our work setup this resulted in my pay not being docked, but it may be different in your place. Depending on how your work and your reporting is structured, this may not work without talking to your supervisor and asking for flexible hours first, so I would do that. If you're refused outright, you have a few options: 1) explain to them politely that if they won't be flexible, you won't be either, and they're not getting any more unpaid overtime work from you (see Mark Booth's comment on your question) 2) explain that, as per the link in Tangurena's answer, they're not treating you as an exempt employee at all: ""To qualify as exempt, employees have to be paid a set amount each pay period, without any reductions based on the quantity or quality of work they do. If you dock their pay, you are treating them like nonexempt employees, and the law might classify them as such, which means they are entitled to overtime."" Still, in the end, if they're persistent about it, all you can do is either put up with it, quit, or sue them (which is probably more annoying that it's worth unless this is a particularly bad problem in your company)."
869,"It's generally a no-no. If you don't think you should be at the meeting in the first place because the issues don't concern you, talk to the people who arrange the attendee list. If the meetings drag on for too long before they get to you, talk to the meeting organizer to see if you can split one big meeting up to a few smaller ones where less time is wasted. If your department is involved, lets say programmers, and you are at the meeting. Even if they are discussing other programmer's issues, it is still your concern since you need to know what's going on around you. What if the person whose issue is being discussed gets hit by a bus? It's just bad manners. There are lots of ways to deal with long meetings, doing work, imho, isn't one of them."
870,"I think a ""casual reference in a meeting"" is a bad idea - either the person will know you're talking about them and will feel put on the spot and humiliated in front of the team, or they won't know you're talking about them and you won't have accomplished anything.  A direct conversation is definitely the way to go, and other answers have already given great pointers on how to deal with that. However, I think the ""implementation of a company wide policy on personal hygiene"" idea has merit as well - in particular, before you implement the ""send them home to shower and dock their pay for the lost time"" idea from other answers, make sure you're legally allowed to do that . If your company has no policy on it, you may not be, in which case if just pointing it out to the employee doesn't work (which in most cases it probably will!), you'll need a policy before you can do anything more specific about it.  At the very least, talk to HR before penalizing an employee for anything that isn't covered in their job description and company policy. Another note - there may be medical issues involved, in which case you may not be able to do much about it without getting into discrimination issues.  Again, definitely check with HR if anything like that comes up during the conversation."
872,"Take the person aside and talk to them. They may not realize it, as I've had coworkers with anosmia (lack of sense of smell) and some with sinus infections. Sinus infections tend to give folks horrible breath - which they cannot smell themselves. I've also lived and worked in other countries where what is considered acceptable is very different from the US. Deodorant for men was considered effeminate until some advertising campaigns during the 1960s."
873,"""It depends."" At a previous (consulting) job it wasn't uncommon to spend the entire day in meetings, but still be required to get things done.   The meetings really didn't need to take all day, but they did, and there wasn't much to do about that: It was happening, you had to at least be on the phone, and that didn't remove that you needed to get work done. Meanwhile, while your input might be occasionally needed, you wouldn't need to be an active participant for most of it. Things would also come up in the meetings that needed to be addressed, and if you didn't have to say anything it was frequently more efficient to work on them while listening for key phrases about what you have to do. So you did work. There are plenty of meetings that people need to attend for one reason or another that they cannot–and are not expected to–dedicate their full attention to, or at least not expected to do so for some percentage of the meeting. It could be argued that this is a flaw in the structure of the meetings, but it's also something that naturally happens when you get a bunch of people in the room: The conversation is not necessarily highly focused and relevant.  Sometimes you are only there to answer questions if people have them, or are only going to be an active participant for ten minutes of a thirty minute meeting. On the other hand, if you are in a small meeting where you are a key participant, even if you could fix an issue that comes up in the scope of the meeting very quickly, it is probably best not to do so if you can reasonably avoid it.  You can slow down a meeting too much by missing key details or by having to have instructions repeated, or can block others if they need to wait for you to finish up a task. Why I think this: It's easy to say ""we should fix this at the meeting organization level,"" it is a much harder problem to actually do that. Various groups have tried standing-only meetings and other such concepts to try and keep meetings focused, but they frequently meander, or they frequently cover multiple topics for which you only care about a few.  Sometimes you know just by the nature of the participant list that it isn't going to start on time, and you make the according arrangements. Ideally your meetings should be sufficiently short and focused that there's no temptation to fix things in the meeting, because it will be over sufficiently quickly that you can get back to it. That said, you can try and get the meeting more focused and get people to take irrelevancies offline.  You can try to keep the socialization down. You can try to do a lot of things like this… but while you are trying to take those steps there's still going to be work to do, and sometimes (e.g., when you are production support) keeping an eye on a monitor is simply not going to be made optional. So grimace, try to get the format fixed, and then make the best decision based on cultural norms at the company (some companies tolerate it more than others) and by gauging the level of distraction relative to the level of benefit for the company."
874,I really think it would depend on whether the others at the meeting would be grateful for your promptness (closing the issue before the meeting even ends) or unhappy at losing your attention or the flow of the meeting while you do the fix.
875,"I can only speak from experience of doing phone interviews in a smaller company. I think the methodology is the same though. The first phone interview is just to weed out the obviously wrong candidates so you don't waste time doing a real interview. Those who wouldn't fit in with the culture, can't speak English or don't know basic technical skills should be identified at this stage. You normally ask a few basic questions about the skills and experience they list on their cv (we had one candidate who put down unit testing on her cv for example. Turns out she had just googled it a few months ago and had no real knowledge...). You also ask a few questions about their past work and ambitions, often you can weed out the candidates that don't actually want to be in the job you're listing. Ultimately it does all boil down to the impression of the interviewers. They chat afterwards and compare overall impressions and key answers. It's very hard to objectively measure people. Also, the objective of the interview is to find those worth spending time on not to actually stretch the good candidates."
877,"So for me, It Depends. I'm lucky enough to be blessed with a convertible tablet PC , and wireless in most meeting rooms, so I usually have it open for making notes in a way that's not obtrusive and let's me also follow what's being said.  This means I can do two things fairly easily; If something comes up as a question, or quick action directly related
to the meeting, I can get it done there and then (i.e find some info
from a network share when someone asks a question, or setup a future
meeting when it's discussed) I can check email.  I only check subject
lines of incoming, but it means 'stop the world' urgent still gets
through to me What I don't do is try to get unrelated work done, it would be possible, but as several have said, it's rude.  It means you're in the meeting but not participating."
878,"If you are hearing about Six Sigma in a typical business office as opposed to a manufacturing facility, what you are hearing is a common and actively advocated misapplication of the methods by which physical products are mass-produced to the quite different work and product challenges of the typical business office. If this misapplication is done with some common sense and attention to actual outcomes, it can result in positive improvements in overall process that lead to products that are more uniform in quality, consistent in formatting and style, and reflective of a good ""corporate memory"" in which past customer concerns and work done are never forgotten. Depending on how well your office currently does on such points, the impact can range from very large (but positive) to not much more than reinforcing good procedures and training already in place. A much more worrisome situation is an overly literal application of the Six Sigma concept of assembly line manufacturing models to the actual content of your office products. Assembly lines reach six sigma by finding where variations in the assembly line process are preventing a physical product from being replicated exactly replicated. E.g., if you are making forks, you want all of the forks of the same type to be as close to identical and to what was intended as possible. The difficulty is that office products such as resolutions of problems with individual clients, or creation of custom software applications, don't follow that model. That is, as soon as you get away from assembly line replication of identical physical products, you don't want every product to be exactly the same, because by definition that means you are not really solving new or unique problems for your customers. True manufacturing literalists -- and I've had to interact with some interesting ones quite directly -- can be very aggressive and evangelical in their approach, often going straight to the top of a corporation and using manufacturing arguments to persuade them to implement such changes throughout a company. I've seen some very unfortunate outcomes in such cases, for the simple reason that case-by-case problem solving really is not much like manufacturing, so much so that the metrics that work for manufacturing can lead you to do literally silly things in other disciplines. Here's a simple example of what I mean by that: You say that you want six-sigma error reduction in software applications, as measured by errors found per thousand lines of Java code, and you don't bother qualifying how to get it. What will the typical outcome be? That's easy: Massive code bloat and a dramatic decline in the production of marketable applications. Huh? Why? Because the easiest way to meet the six sigma quality metric is to pack the Java code with proven and/or meaningless replication of ""safe"" code. How about for sales? Even worse. Certain office activities absolutely must accommodate large margins of failure in the details in order to succeed overall. Expecting most efforts to fail is for example the very essence of the venture capital model. Misapplying six sigma precepts in that context -- that is, to exploratory processes for which failure in the details is fundamental to finding the nuggets of success -- is just plain scary. I would like to say that no advocate of either six sigma or other quality processes would be so silly as to do that, but the unfortunate truth is that companies that advocate such methods often hire inexperienced people to promote their ideas, just like the rest of us. An enthusiastic advocate who is unhampered by the experience of abject failure of whatever they are advocating often can be very persuasive for promoting its use in bad spots. So, bottom line: How six sigma will affect your office depends on many variables, including how your office currently operates, what variant of six sigma is being applied, and (especially critical) how experienced the proponents of such methods are at knowing the differences between changes that can truly help (e.g. quality uniformity, corporate memory) and change that can be devastating (e.g., forcing ""super safe"" behavior by people whose jobs cannot succeed overall without allowing individual failures). But one thing should always be kept in mind, especially by people considering (versus responding to) the application of six sigma methods: Unless you are doing true manufacturing of actual, physical products on an assembly line, the analogy is and always will be false. Processes that work well for offices must accommodate and encourage creative problems solving, and use must use metrics that encourage both. You won't find them in six sigma because they aren't there, at least not for the actual ""six sigma"" problem reduction part."
879,"Six Sigma is a program to improve quality of the products an organization makes. It initially focus on manufacturing, but it has been expanded into into services. The goal is to make sure that even the items on the ends of the bell curve, will pass the quality control checks. Since most people don't produce enough items it is impossible for the 3.4 defects per million objects to be applicable. No developer could achieve that goal. At 100 lines of code per day, a developer would only be allowed 3.4 bugs in their career. The other part of six sigma are the tools and methods use to evaluate the current process, find root causes, propose solution, test them, and evaluate the results. The tools are interesting, but the key is realizing that the overall methodology is the scientific method. You don't tweak the process until you have crated a hypothesis and done an experiment. Will it change your job? IT can't be successful unless the correct levels of management encourage it, and nurture it. The power to design the experiment, and test the hypothesis is done by the team. If a team learns that every time they resolve an issue management files their report away, and never follows through; they will stop trying to fix problems. Organizations that have tried to fake six sigma, or TQM, or quality circles by ignoring the results, or by  creating teams to work on minor problems end up wasting time and money with no real results. Organizations that nurture the process, reward the participants, encourage participation,end up with a better product. It might be better quality, lower costs, less waste, but it should lead to a better bottom line."
880,"Know your own limits.  My personal rule is that I drink no more than half of what I know I can safely handle (e.g. if I know that having a couple glasses of wine won't impair me, I'll have one glass, not two).  Better safe than sorry. Within the limits of #1, follow suit but don't raise the stakes.  If everybody else orders beer and you want to fit in, order a beer -- but not whiskey. If for any reason you don't want to drink, remember that Coke looks the same as Rum & Coke, 7-Up looks the same as a Highball, and so on.  If the setting is a walk-up bar rather than drinks ordered from a waiter at a table, no one will ever know if you don't say anything. If you don't want to drink but fear judgment from an alcohol-focused culture, ""I can't right now"" is nicely ambiguous -- maybe you're on some medication that precludes alcohol, for instance.  But if these are your coworkers, you may have a longer-term problem here -- you can use this at one party, but not every week."
881,"I work for a large government contractor (high-tech).  We have a standard set of questions from which we draw for phone screens (so everyone's getting measured against the same yardstick), and the phone-screener submits a written evaluation, not just a yes/no.  The written evaluation covers both technical issues and soft skills; in the phone screen the focus is on the technical, but issues around communication ability, or if the person volunteers any information about how he works in teams or the like, will also get noted here.  (We use the same form for the on-site interview.)  The evaluation ends with a recommendation, which is a free-text field (not yes/no).  So, for example, a recommendation might be ""interview, and drill into (some area that was weak on the phone)"", or ""consider for a lower grade"" (the senior position he applied for isn't a fit but he'd be good to have on the team in another capacity).  I think a rejection after the phone screen involves a consultation between the screener and the hiring manager. Bottom line: yes, the phone-screener's opinion is pretty important, but that opinion has to be backed up by documentation.  If the screen is positive an interview with several people follows."
882,"If the style of the meeting makes it appropriate then yes complete those small tasks. If the meeting is close to being a hackathon then not only is it appropriate, but it is probably even appreciated. I have even used a smartphone/laptop to pull up relevant info to keep the meeting moving. I have also been involved with projects where the meeting is designed to be one way communication, so fixing the problem as soon as it is mentioned would be seen as disrespectful. I prefer meetings and projects where participants feel comfortable with responding to requests in real time."
883,"The time-honored way to deal with bosses who have unreasonable expectations is to band together and form a labor movement. If your country has trade unions , join one that defends workers in your branch and category. If it doesn't, consider joining an underground labor movement (but note that it can be dangerous). If you live in a place where the labor market is in your favor, change jobs."
884,"Practicing drama or music, or getting used to public speaking (for example by being active in a non-protit organization or a  political movement), can be very good training for such stressful situations. It's well-known that there are two kinds of actors: those whose knees shake before a performance, and those who've learned to ignore the shaking. Picturing the other person in their underwear is also said to boost your confidence by clearing any perception of superiority you may have about the other person. It doesn't work for everybody in every circumstance."
885,I can very much understand this question. I am self employed and is very nearly impossible to take a vacation without conducting business. My best plan is to take an hour in morning and in evening. Leave a voice mail indicating response times. I've found this to work best.
886,"If someone is working on their laptop during a meeting, it means they think that work is more important than the meeting. To put it more bluntly, they believe you're wasting their time . Do you trust them to make that decision correctly? If yes, it's time to change what you're doing. If no, it's time to change where you work. Meeting behaviors are part of the corporate culture . Don't assume that how you do meetings right now is the only way to do them. For example, the value each person gets out of a meeting decreases with the number of people in there. Since this loss is repeated with every attendee, meeting value decreases O(n^2). Small meetings are easier to make valuable. A short meeting only has enough time for the most important topics. Thus, longer meetings spend time on less important topics, reducing the value of everyone's time. Keeping meetings short also helps people feel confident that they will have time to do their regular work later, so they can give their full attention to this meeting now, increasing its value for everyone. I've been to a lot of meetings where the someone hands out copies of a document for everyone to read and comment on in the meeting. This is terribly inefficient. The problem is, in a rushed culture, people won't read beforehand because they don't think they have enough time. This is a cultural concern that must be changed to get the most value out of meetings."
887,"Like Tom Squires, I only have experience in conducting phone interviews for smaller companies. But yes, it is a screening interview, which means it really is going to boil down to ""no, don't proceed any further with this candidate"", or ""yes, get this candidate in for an interview"". Obviously there are degrees from ""no"" to ""HELL NO!"" and from ""yes"" to ""yes get them in RIGHT NOW!!"", but ultimately it's a filter. And in my experience (this could well be different at larger companies), it is indeed all in the hands of the phone interviewer, without any particular discussion of the interview. The goal of the phone interview is to filter out unsuitable candidates with the minimum amount of time and effort, which does pretty much mean one person needs to take care of it, not a group. Objective or subjective measurements? I'd like to think it would be more objective than a full interview. I'd prepare some questions based on the candidate's resume and previous work, and if they couldn't answer them to a satisfactory degree, that would probably make the outcome a ""no"". But I'd be reluctant to rule someone out based on ""vibe"", I'd prefer to leave that sort of judgement to a face-to-face interview with multiple interviewers."
888,"If there is no sign of there being any usage or requirement of LaTeX at the job you're applying for, then I would say it falls under general rules of keeping your resume focused and to-the-point. If you're needing to trim in order to keep it brief, then trim out less relevant skills like LaTeX. But I honestly can't think of any situation where it would be a negative just to have it there. Sure there are some technologies which do attract a degree of prejudice from some people in hiring positions (e.g. Visual Basic), but I'd be amazed if LaTeX was one of them. Frankly, I suspect that anyone who would be prejudiced against it on the grounds of it being ""too academic"" wouldn't actually be familiar with the name."
890,"I made a possible mistake on a live project at work, how to handle this mess?. I am a software developer that just started out in this company. It's been almost three weeks. On Friday when I was about to leave work, a co-worker stopped me and told me to make changes to already working code. The fact that this live project would be used over the weekend by a real client in a production environment was not made known to me. Usually QA tests everything, but strangely enough, no QA was notified and no functional tests where run. I got a phone call this morning from the project manager who sounds panicked, and asking me what changes I made. I also talked to a senior developer and he's screaming at me that I did not test or fully write it and that he has to make the fixes. So I speak to the project manager again and he says we will all have a meeting. If I had known that this was to be run on Sunday live, I would've tested out the code. I do believe I am at fault here and I should probably own up to it. But I feel a bit angered that I listened to a co-worker blindly without consulting the project manager or senior developer. If those modifications suggested by the co-worker hadn't been made, everything would've worked perfectly. He needed those modifications so he could use it in his other project. No ill intention was there, but overall there wasn't the same level of awareness or urgency passed along here. Now I fear that I may be fired because I have not been at this company long.  On Monday, what should I do? This is my first time working as a developer and while I desperately tried not to make critical mistakes, it happened. Now I am at a loss as to how to deal with this overall situation."
891,"If I had known that this was to be run on Sunday live, I would've
  tested out the code. This is your first mistake. Why is there a pre-condition on you testing your code? You should always test your code and never rely on QA to have your back. That is not QA's job. Whatever you do, don't say any of what you wrote here in your meeting. This is 100% your fault and the only thing you can do is 100% own up to it. Say you broke it, you did not test it and that you are actively looking into ways to perform unit and integration tests so that this won't happen again. Here is another way to look at things. One of the big things that Civil Engineers used to grief Software Engineers about is liability and the lack of any licensing. If a Civil Engineer makes a blunder while building a bridge and someone gets killed while driving over it, that Engineer is liable for that mistake. Can you imagine if he went on the news and said ""My coworker didn't tell me that cars were going to drive over it during the weekend."" While the Live software might not literally be life and death, to some companies a Live system breaking can be very close to feeling like it."
892,"Definitely own up to your mistake - this is clearly your fault, since you didn't do the tests, and the fact that other people may have been at fault as well is no excuse. (And in any case, maybe they didn't - maybe you should have known the system was going to be live on Sunday and you just didn't check some important resource to find out!) However, the other important step is to make it clear this won't happen again - not by promising it won't, but by explaining why it happened and what steps you're going to take to prevent it in the future, and, if necessary (which it seems like it is), asking for help .  It looks like you were missing some important information - ask for guidelines on how to deal with requests for last-minute changes, where to check to make sure what would be going live when, etc.  Again, the point of this is not to put the blame on anyone else, but to figure out exactly what you did wrong or what you should have known and all the things you can do to make better decisions in the future. Hopefully it will become clear that your mistake was due to something that's easily fixable, and everyone will feel reasonably confident that it won't happen again. The fact that you're new at the job may work in your favor here - new people are expected to make some mistakes and to improve rapidly . If, after working there for a year, you still didn't know enough to keep from causing this kind of issue, it would clearly be a sign of a significant problem, but since you've not been there long enough to be very familiar with how everything works, people may feel that this was a newbie mistake that's unlikely to be repeated. Again - this is really the most important point here - during the meeting, make it obvious that your priority is preventing the problem from happening again, not avoiding blame , and they may decide that approach makes you a good enough employee to keep."
893,"Making a mistake as a new employee is truly nerve wrecking, but seeing that it was your first mistake it is unlikely that you will be fired as taking on new employees always implies and investment that they will be reluctant to lose. I would suggest the following: Remember to ALWAYS test your code before deploying. This is a rule you should never break. Find out how change control and the development cycle works at your company, ie:
Are informal requests allowed or do they need to be specified and signed off prior to development?
When and by whom are changes deployed?
When and where does testing take place?
If there is no controlled process in place, you can potentially score points on helping them to put this in place ;-) It there is, your employer should have explained this process to you clearly so as to prevent a mistake like this. Find out what the line of command is. 
Who has the authority to request and sign off changes? 
Once you have the answer, NEVER act on change requests from an unauthorized person without checking with the correct authority. It is not clear from your post where you implemented your changes. Did you deploy them directly to a production server? It is essential to have a staging or development server where developers can test their code prior to deployment to production. To best prevent these kind of mistakes, ideally developers should not have direct access to the production servers and tested code should be deployed to production only after Q&A has signed it off. This should happen as part of a controlled change control process. Taking responsibility doesn't just mean owning up to your mistake, but also by taking part in the implementation of processes that make things work better. Good luck with the meeting!"
894,"You have culpability here but I would say it is not entirely your fault. Of course as a developer you should always test your own code before checking in and should NEVER rely upon QA as a test plan.  This goes without saying. On the other hand, I strongly feel that they should take some blame here too: They did not communicate to you when the code was going to be deployed to live/production/client. A peer did not review your code changes before going through the QA process.  This should be mandatory policy on your team, especially for junior and new developers on the team. Their QA team should have been more thorough before blindly authorizing the release of software to production. Don't let them place all the blame on you, own your mistakes but point out the other failure points that led to the situation.  If your manager and your company for that matter is a worthwhile place to work for they will be more concerned about resolving the issue than punishing with blame. We all make mistakes, every one of us."
895,"To change your culture you need to realize why you are experiencing resistance and then manage the cause of the resistance. In my experience, ""coordinating with other departments"" tends to be the province of those with higher position titles and headed down a project/people management track.  Work-a-day devs interested only in code tend to be shielded from this.  In more structured shops, they may not do it at all and in smaller shops, they may do it more informally. Like it or not, you've inherited a flex hours culture, which is a huge perk for most developers.  Taking that away from them in one of your first acts as leader not will not only seem tyrannical to them (when you explain to them that 9:30 isn't that early, you're imposing your own schedule on them, arbitrarily in their opinion), but is realistically the subtraction of a substantial perk.  You may like working a particular schedule and not consider this to be a meaningful perk, but they probably consider it invaluable.  Consider this on par with telling them you're taking away a week of their vacation or cutting their pay by a few percent. To change that, you can use the carrot or the stick.  You're talking about using a stick and, maybe, a bigger stick.  If you go that route, I'd plan to hire a few new developers, as I'm guessing that some of your team is going to start going on interviews at other companies.  I would personally go the carrot route in order to get buyin for removal of this perk by making it clear that future promotions and advancements will be decided by those who ""coordinate with other departments"".  That is, leaders/important people are in early, working with other teams, taking on responsibilities, etc.  ""Newbies"" get the flex perk, but people serious about advancing get in on time. If you create that culture, I suspect that some of your devs will start coming in on time of their own accord.  Both due to interest in advancement and due to the perception that ""the important people get in early."""
896,"How can I determine a reasonable salary to ask for?. I'm looking for a comprehensive answer to this question, not short answers that just tell me one piece of the equation. The ideal answer should include: How can I determine the average salary rate for my position? What statistics affect the sort of salary I can ask for? (location, skillset, experience, education, etc) Do employment benefits play a role in the salary amount I should ask for?"
897,"How persistent should you be when you're low priority/ignored as a new or entry-level employee?. Background: I'm working a fairly entry level job in Information Technology for a company I've been with for nearly a year now. 
I've been hired part time after interning initially for 3 months. 
After receiving my bachelor's I will begin working full time for the company Question: I'm often working on projects from various levels of priority, mainly fairly low because of my experience. Being inexperienced however, I often require additional help or instructions from members of the company. My experience with replies range from taking weeks, to often not receiving a reply at all from different sources of help. This can often lead to my projects stalling completely. How often or how persistent should I be when it comes to following up with these requests? 
Is this normal to expect as an entry level employee? It's difficult to tell sometimes if they're deliberately seeing if I'll show traits of persistence or if they're simply too busy to deal with my requests. I don't want to show that I lack initiative and drive; however, I don't wish to be a thorn in the side of my employees. Thank you for your input."
898,"You should take initiative; not to bug them again, but to go find the answer. I don't know the nature of your work, but in my own experience, if a worker is given access to the data and tools to do their job, then rarely do they absolutely have to wait on a coworker for an answer. If you're waiting for: General knowledge :  Google it.  Develop your research and investigation skills by using a combination of what you know and what problems/unknowns you see.  Ask questions on forums. Understanding of proprietary systems you have access to :  Dig in and find out how things work.  Ask a variety of people, not just one.  It's like above, but it's an internal search. Understanding of proprietary systems you don't have access to :  If you've asked once, then before you ask again, make sure you can show what you've found out in the meantime.  And, like above, ask more than one person for help. Someone to make a decision :  This is the most difficult to figure out as an entry-level employee. However, you still need to take initiative.  Instead of just expecting your manager or a senior employee to make a call, you should become an expert in the facts, consider potential solutions, understand pros and cons, and finally make a recommendation. At a minimum, this will help the senior worker to make the decision, even if it doesn't match your recommendation.  As you gain experience, you will be more likely to make the right call and they will simply sign off on your recommendation. Summary: Show initiative by doing as much as you can before returning to ask the question again. Take ownership , no matter how low the priority of your projects is in the company.  This will show that you are the right person to take on projects of increasing importance."
899,"Indeed.com has a pretty good salary calculation tool . This would give you a decent estimate for many career areas. For example, it shows $118,000 as the average for a C# programmer in NYC compared to $75,000 for one in Minot, ND with a US average of $92,000.  The data comes from job listings and other publicly available sources. You can even include additional search keywords to find estimates for degrees and experience but this is a bit more tricky. Beyond this, it will tend to get company/organization specific. You can use sources like Glassdoor to research company specific salary and benefit information as well as getting some insight into the company. This will tell you if the company you're applying to is paying average or above or below average. Benefits should be part of your salary consideration. This also varies from company to company. Larger corporations and government agencies, especially ones with unions, tend to have the best benefits packages although this usually comes with a lower salary. Smaller companies will tend to offer fewer benefits but will often compensate for this with higher pay or other perks. You'll have to weigh which best fits your needs."
900,"The first thing you should do is find out what other people in similar situations are earning. When I say ""similar"", I mean that the work is similar, they live in the same city (or near it) as you, they have been in that role for about the same amount of time as you, they have similar experience as you. Of course it might be difficult to find many people who fit this exactly, so you'll probably end up with an approximation. You can start with your own organization, if you don't feel uncomfortable asking your coworkers how much they make. Talk to other people you know who work in other companies to get an idea of how things are different in other places. You could also talk to HR. Sometimes they will have a job grade matrix that they will share and it will show you the different title, job grades, and pay ranges (where I am that information is available to all). That will be a good start for a ball-park figure. As others have mentioned, there are websites such as Glassdoor that can also help you figure out a good starting figure to work with. In general, it seems that the easier it is for many people to qualify for the job, the harder it will be to ask for an above-the-broader-industry-average salary. If you possess the exact skillset/experiences an employer wants, you can ask for more than average, especially if it's a specialized or niche skill set. If you don't possess those skills, it will obviously be harder for you to justify asking for that high a salary. I think for many jobs, education won't let you ask for that much extra salary, unless it's a very specialized type of role that would already require an advanced degree in a subject related to the job (such as computer vision, AI, etc...) and in that case the job might be niche enough to already let you ask a higher-than-average salary. As for benefits, I would imagine that if an employer offers exceptionally good benefits then it might be expected they will not pay as well as others. Similarly, if an employer offers very few benefits you could ask for a higher salary to make up the difference in benefits that you would have gotten elsewhere."
901,"Were you assigned a direct mentor/supervisor for your internship? Assuming you're in a situation that really truly requires help from within the company, this is the person you should go to with all your questions. S/he can then decide who is best suited to help and ask that person for you. Building on NickC's comments about proprietary systems, ask your supervisor or HR manager if you can cross-train with groups using everything you interact with . If they've already committed to hiring you upon graduation, they should be committed to helping you succeed within the company."
902,"How can I motivate myself to work on projects I don't believe in or care about?. I am generally pretty good at getting stuff done.  In fact that's my reputation.  I am very productive as long as I think the project is interesting or think it will do a lot to help our company and/or customers.  I'm really fortunate to get to work on that kind of stuff most of the time. And then sometimes I get these really sucky projects or parts of projects where I believe my work is not going to produce any fruit for anyone, and where the work is a huge drag, monotonous or difficult, and having no inherent inerestingness about it. And then of course, that work drags on and on because I hate it and cannot get myself engaged enough to get really cooking on it... What can I do to kick myself into gear when I am working on this kind of thing?"
903,"Think about the cash... the cash always works. It may sound funny, but it's true. If you think about the money you are going to earn, and your job security, you'll be all good. Of course, this may not work for everyone (i.e. people who's religion forbids them from admiring material things), but it works for me!"
904,"The others raise a lot of good points about how to handle the situation; however, at the end of the day, if the schedule of your group is disrupting others in the company then you must correct the problem and ensure that things run smoothly. With this in mind, you need to find out when other groups need reliable access to the developers and if there is any room for flexibility in that schedule. If other groups need access to developers when they are at the office on an unpredictable basis then a core segment of developers need to make sure that need is accommodated. If this means that some developers have to be at the office at fixed periods of time, then it is what it is. With regards to moving the developers to some sort of a fixed availability schedule, your best bet is to ensure that any ""hard hours"" are softened as much as possible. For example, if the ""core hours"" are from 11:00 to 15:00 then you can also make sure that the core hours on Friday are not present and Friday is a true flex time day. As Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are traditionally considered the most productive days of the week you might be able to have the core hours apply to those days and allow Monday and Friday to be full flex days as well. In terms of ensure that the hours are adhered to, if the direction comes down from the top and is approved by upper management then ultimately the developers must adhere to it as part of their employment. You should do what you can to ensure that it is phased in and if some developers have flex-time written into their employment agreement it should be addressed (eg. by changing their compensation and benefits, grandfathering them in, etc.); however, at some point you are going to have to ensure that the policy needs to be adhered to which may also require official disciplining of employees. Likewise, if some choose to leave it may be worth trying to see if they are willing to stay with compensation and benefits changes; however you may also have to accept losing some of the developers. Ultimately, if your job requires that you enforce a cultural change to the group to meet the needs of the business then you options are going to be limited to an extent. You can and should do everything to soften the change and elicit any compromises with other groups as you can, but eventually you will need to enforce the change and accept any personnel change that may come with it."
905,"You look forward to the projects you do find exciting. Every profession has boring/tedious/monotonous aspects. Take for example, a pro basketball player.  The most exciting part for a pro basketball player is actually playing in games.  Behind the scenes, they may have a lot of traveling, paperwork, attending practices, exercising and so on, that is not exciting. So you can tell yourself, ""The sooner I finish lame project X, I can start working on awesome project Y"""
907,"How can I determine the average salary rate for my position? There are a few ways to analyze this: Use salary websites such as Glassdoor.com , Indeed.com or bls.gov (for jobs in the USA).  Salary websites will usually take into account your job title, years of experience, and location. Keep in mind that they will sometimes lump benefits in with the salary figure shown, so the dollar amount presented may be larger than what you should ask for depending on what benefits the company offers. Surveying people (colleagues/recruiters) in the same locality or even company.  To avoid asking someone their salary directly (because that is not polite), you can ask them what range someone with their skillset/experience would typically get. Interviewing and actually getting offers . This would be before you negotiate with them; if you have multiple written offers, it is easy to compare. What statistics affect the sort of salary I can ask for? Location : This is one of the biggest things that affects the sort of salary you can ask for. Some factors that play a role include: Supply/Demand - A place that has a high demand and a low supply will obviously pay more than a location with a low demand and a high supply. Cost of Living - Some cities have a very high cost of living, so many jobs there will pay a higher salary than a place with a low cost of living. Taxes - A company is likely to pay you a lower rate in a location that has lower taxes. For example, in the US there are 7 states where you don't pay state taxes, or if you are working as an expatriate in some countries, you may not have to pay taxes at all. Experience : Someone with a lot of experience is in higher demand than someone with no experience, so they can ask for a higher salary since multiple companies are usually competing for their skills. Education : Your degree does not entitle you to have a higher salary rate, however the degree is supposed to be proof that you have the knowledge and skills typically required for a job. As with experience, someone with a degree is usually in higher demand than someone without a degree, and it can often be used to negotiate a higher salary. Skill Set : Companies want someone with skills to match the job they're hiring for, so if you have the exact skills they're looking for, you might be able to ask for a higher rate than if you only had related skills. In addition, some skills are rarer to find than others, so if you have a rare language on your resume, then you may be able to ask for more than if you had a common one. Telecommuting : You may get less money since some companies factor in  cost-of-living/travel expenses into the salary Company Size : Larger corporations and government agencies, especially ones with unions, tend to have the best benefits packages although this usually comes with a lower salary. Smaller companies will tend to offer fewer benefits but will often compensate for this with higher pay or other perks Do employment benefits play a role in the salary amount I should ask for? Absolutely. Here are some common benefits which often affect the dollar amount of your salary Healthcare In some countries, healthcare is provided by the government, so that can affect your salary If you work as an independent contractor, you may get more money since the company is not paying for your healthcare. Some companies pay more for health benefits than other companies so you may have to pay more out of pocket even if you have a higher salary 401k matching/stock options Not every company provides these benefits Earned Time off/Vacation For contractors or people with no ETO, there is a dollar amount attached to each time you take a day off If you have more time off available, this can be factored into the salary since you are, in a sense, being paid to not work. Pensions A small number of employers offer Defined Benefit pensions (pension is calculated on number of years of service x a multiplier) Some countries enforce pension contributions - which impacts your take home pay"
908,"Can I charge for email support as a freelancer?. I work as web consultant (freelancer). I work basically from home at an hourly rate. In my contract which was mostly through email, I am supposed to charge in increment of 30min. If something takes less than in 10 min. to fix, a charge for 30min will apply. If something gets fixed in 40min, charges of 1 hour will apply. My question is about email support. I often get email from clients asking about various questions and the work that I do. These are not tasks for me but something like, this is not working, the page is broke, it does not work on my pc etc etc.  My question is, is technical support chargeable as freelancer? One might suggest to just add up these hours. However it does not take that long to answer these email, something around 1min to 10min, but it does interrupt my regular work."
909,"Yes email support should be chargeable. You would charge for telephone support also. Is it on your contract? Only you can answer that question. When I had to support contracts like this the key was how quickly did they want an answer. If they expect a 24 hr turn around, then you can gather all the ones you receive that day and answer them in a single block of time. But if they want them ASAP, then you will have to treat them as separate jobs, charging a minimum of 30 minutes. Try to be kind to them if they always follow up with a related question, answer a short email for free every once in awhile."
910,"For any questions regarding billing, it is of the utmost importance to go directly to your contract and verify: the description of your services for hire the rate of pay for each service you are contracted to perform If your contract states that you are performing ""consulting services"" -- which can range from A to Z and anything in between -- at a fee of N per hour (calculated as you've indicated), then yes, charge for email consultation, phone consultation, and any other activity applicable to your work for that client . Unless your contract states that you are billing very specific tasks at very specific rates , then anything you do that requires effort and thought on behalf of the client is billable. I would note that mhoran_psprep brings up the good point of the occasional good faith freebies -- and those are always your discretion. To recap: anything you do is billable unless you have signed a contract that locks you in to piece work or flat rate bid, and if your services and rates are not explicit in this contract, make sure they are in your next one."
911,"Getting fired on the second day, how do I cope with it?. I got hired as consultant (hardware engineer) after a brief phone interview that went really well. He was impressed not only with my skill A but also skill B and C. I was asked to join immediately. It was basically a one man's company where the owner was the sole employee (design engineer). I was hired through a recruiting agency. On my second day after I was on my way to home, I received call from the recruiter, asking me not to go to work tomorrow. I was in a shock. I was not given a clear reason but was told he needed someone with more experience. This gave me great pains because He had reviewed my resume He had interviewed me over the phone We had talked about my previous experiences I did not oversell myself, in fact was quite honest enough about my past projects. There was nothing false in my resume. I did not make any mistake in the two days that I worked I did not get enough time for my skills to be properly evaluated (only 14 hours of work) The termination was on phone He never spoke to me in person. Do I have any options here? Can I fight for my rights here when I am not apparently at fault? How do I cope with this situation now and in future."
912,"I think this is one of the perils of doing interviews over the phone. You don't get to do a proper face to face where details can be touched upon and body language, personalities explored. Is it fair for employer to fire someone on the next day over the phone
  with out giving any solid reason? Is it common? No, it isn't common unless the recruit has done something ridiculous and no, it doesn't seem fair unless some major error was made or character flaw discovered. As for not telling you face to face, it could either be a personality issue or maybe he feels bad about it as well and doesn't want to be confronted. Can the employee do anything about it if this is something violates
  him/her emotionally just because it is against common code of conduct? This would depend on your employment contract. I always insist on contracts that have a mandatory, minimum 30 day notice on termination (either from me or from the company) with a minimum service period of 3 months because you can't go back to your old job if this new one doesn't work out. Seriously, just don't take jobs over the phone unless you are currently unemployed and job prospects are slim, it's generally a lot riskier for both parties."
913,"In a typical scenario, it shouldn't have been so bad. Bad luck truly. But i think the primary reason why you have been told no is that prospect project collapsed. I could have been a day before you join or a day after - that could have just been a co-incidence. However, this experience should tell us more of the following: Ref check of employers is just important as ref checks of employees. Yes, in most cases, when we are dealing with big companies is always available - however, it is not a given that company always is reliable. Personal interview is usually a must; and at least you should know the horizons and path for your career ahead. In a situation like this you should have asked for a personal meet with the proprietor and have one-to-one about what went wrong. May be you could just make a call now! So coming to your question: Is it fair for employer to fire someone on the next day over the phone
  with out giving any solid reason? Is it common? From professional companies, it is not common. But it is okay to say GOODBYE WITHOUT giving reason. Can the employee do anything about it if this is something violates
  him/her emotionally just because it is against common code of conduct? Ok, depending on the norms and law, you CAN really question this in some parts of the world. But i think there is not much hope to get good out of it. You cannot really fight to get the job back - but you can ask for compensation, certificate or even joining bonus if promised. TIP: 
Since it's only been 1 day for you, it doesn't look like a big gap, you can just forget about it and join some other organization quickly."
914,"Only if it helps the meeting. I would consider these cases to be acceptable and helpful: Looking up a piece of information that is missing or incorrect in the presentation materials Doing a quick google search for a more detailed version of a presented document (for example, look up the full price chart from a vendor's website) Don't do research or try to solve a problem during a meeting. The following would fall in this bad category: Do a ""quick"" google search to find and compare options for an item under discussion (a diligent comparison would require some concentrated effort, which doesn't interest most of the people in the room) Start incorporating the feedback by others into the deliverables during the meeting (just make a note, move on, and contact only the interested parties later)"
915,"Working late without overtime pay, good idea or not?. So I've read through How do I maintain a work-life balance when company culture tends towards frequent overtime? and that is very similar situation that I found myself in. There's no explicit guidelines or any instructions to stay late to work, but it seems like half of the developers here seem to stay overtime without receiving extra pay for it. I have 10 minute lunch break while lot of people go out for 45~1 hour lunch breaks. It feels bad everytime I have to leave on time while some of the other developers on my team are still working. All in all, I make sure that I am on schedule and meeting deadlines. However, I just don't understand why the other developers work extra hours even when there's no real pending reason. It seems like they end up with more work to do because they are working ahead of time. I double checked that there's no overtime pay or compensation at all with HR. So what is the explanation of this behavior? Should I follow or not? This is quite stressful to think about. There's no set guidelines of when to start working or when to stop. As long as projects are completed on time is what they keep telling me and they are, but why are some of the other developers staying behind to do extra work? Is that how you get promoted or get a salary bump? We have this web app where we have the option of recording how much hour we spend each day but this is for project managers and definitely not for calculating overtime pay. It seems like me and another person are the only ones to actually leave and not do overtime work. Sometimes I do but that's because the project is urgent and I do not mind that at all. But it's like this group behavior that worries me because if I have to keep working overtime like that it wouldn't work for me. I need to have a set time limit to concentrate and work in bursts, I can't do coding marathons...."
916,"As long as your manager isn't pressing you to do overtime and you're not being penalized for your schedule, don't worry about it.  People have different work habit's, don't stress out about other's habits unless they are negatively effecting you. If you want to know how you get promoted or a salary bump, ask your supervisor."
917,"If you know this kind of regular overtime work isn't for you (which I think is a healthy attitude, but it's also a personal preference), then just don't do it .  Most probably nobody will complain, since you are on schedule and meeting deadlines. If it does become a problem, you'll still have the option of having a discussion with your supervisor about it and explaining you just can't be productive on that kind of schedule in the long term. And if it turns out they really do expect those kinds of hours, well, you should probably just start looking for another job - it doesn't sound like a good fit for you. As for why everyone else is doing it - I wouldn't worry too much about it. Maybe you just got a group of ""workaholics"" by chance. Maybe they spend half their day checking their email and make up for it with later hours. Maybe they're all looking at each other and not wanting to be the first to leave, or don't know why it's going on any better than you do.  Or maybe there really is a practical reason why most people in the group are keeping those hours, but if that's the case, you'll find out sooner or later, and I don't think it'd worth going along with that kind of schedule until you at least know what's going on. You sound very stressed out about it, and I think feeling stressed out about your job is much more likely to hurt your productivity and your position in the team than the hours you keep."
918,"I don't think it's common - I've never heard of it happening before, especially without it being clear to the employee why it happened.  It sounds extremely unprofessional to me. However, I don't think there's much you can do about it, either. What would you want to do about it, anyway? Your ex-employer didn't want you working there any more and didn't want to give an explanation - you can't force either one out of them. (Unless you had a contract that specified a notice period). If you can't think of any clear reason why it happened (and for that kind of reaction to make sense, it would have to be really obvious), and nobody's telling you, then I think you can reasonably enough tell yourself that your ex-employer screwed up and you shouldn't take it personally. It's difficult, but people in the workplace aren't your personal friends, and there's no point in letting conflicts with them affect you emotionally. That said, while I don't think you can get much out of the employer, you may have better luck with the recruiter - they may have some idea what was going on, or whether this is just a habit with that particular employer, and may be able to tell you if this is something that happens often in your area and line of work better than we can. In general, recruiters can be more willing to communicate with you, as they are much more likely to be dealing with you again than ex-employers."
920,"First of all don't assume that high desk time is proof someone is working harder. Most people can't maintain working at anywhere near capacity for over eight hours, especially in an intellectually taxing job like programming. The majority of the time when people put in longer hours they end up working significantly below capacity (surfing on the net ect.). Although that may suit some people better it is no more productive and is often less so. The key here is to be confident in your results. If you are producing your work then there is nothing to be worried about and no need to do overtime or change your habits. Any descent manager will judge you based on results rather than desk time."
921,"Is it fair for employer to fire someone on the next day over the phone
  with out giving any solid reason? Is it common? It sound like this company just gets candidates to do a few days work rather than doing an interview. A questionable policy as it stands but downright immoral when it wasn't communicated to you as such. No it's not common. Just think of this as a failed interview rather than a failed job. That's what it is. Can the employee do anything about it if this is something violates
  him/her emotionally just because it is against common code of conduct? Depends on your contract. A standard contract will have a probationary period where they can let you go just because they don't like you. So long as they pay you to the end of your notice term I suspect they are acting fully legally. You could send them a letter detailing why their policy is unfair but I would recommend against it. You don't stand to gain anything and your better spending your efforts finding a new position. Good luck"

Stressed and irritated at work and home for whole year. Emotional worn down/close to tears on a few occasions in last few months. When discussing it one on one recently, have been short of breath, pain in left arm and dizzy . On other occasions, felt ""heaviness"" in my chest. Update: thanks for all the answers and concerned messages. I left this place some time ago and have not had these symptoms for some time, so I think the recovery is working. I did seek medical advice (which was sadly not very useful) but since this was just before I left, that did not matter in this instance."
923,"People have reasons for firing a new employee, and some of them are even good reasons, but firing you by telling the RECRUITER is rank cowardice. Not letting you know why you're being let go is, again, cowardice. Tell everybody you think he fired you because you're black, especially if you're actually white. What legal leverage you have depends on the local laws and whatever contracts you signed. In the United States, most places you've got nothing. Two things you can do: file for unemployment compensation which will raise this guy's UI premiums, and tell everybody you know what happened, with details."
924,"As mentioned in my comments, an answer to this is difficult. But I think it’s worth to try because I'm somewhat shocked by your question. Perhaps this can at least give others some more ideas. If you have physical symptoms like pain in your left arm, heaviness in your chest etc., I think that your situation has to change before you are in hospital (or cemetery). What I can't assess is your personal situation. Does a sick leave really help you for longer terms? Do you have a family to feed? How difficult is it for you to change (internal or external to your company)? Or in other words: What is possible for you to change your situation permanently? I hope that others here can give some more ideas, or you're going to precise your situation somewhat more. Take care of you, Dude"
926,"To your main question, yes of course you should charge.  Anything that takes time, you should charge for.  You might want to maintain a count of emails though and charge (say) 10 minutes or 15 minutes per email. But I'm also struck by your remark that emails interrupt your regular work.  This suggests to me that you have sounds or alerts turned on for email while you're working - something you should turn off to allow you to be more productive.  Prioritize email down when you're doing project work - you'll be surprised at the difference in your ability to get things done."
927,"As per my comment, I would genuinely suggest you visit a doctor and have them sign you off due to stress. Given that you're experiencing physical symptoms, such as pain in the left arm and a tight chest, it's really important you go and at least have a chat with a medical professional."
928,"Your question is woefully deficient on details, because the base question is if what had happened to you was fair or not. This unsurprisingly depends on your employment status, who you were actually employed by, and what state you live in. As an independent contractor on a standard 1099 contract, you are NOT an employee of the Company, but you are an independent entity of the company where you agree to perform requested services for an agreed upon compensation.  In this contract, both parties have the right to terminate it going forward for no reason at all. As an employee of a consultant company or recruiting agency you would be considered an employee that happens to be performing work at a company per the instructions and agreements by your employer and this company.  If the company doesn't want you back then you may not be working and not getting paid, however you would still be considered an employee of the agency and they would be responsible for finding additional work for you. As an employee of the Company you will get a W2 but the employer will have certain rules and ways that they should go about things when it comes to termination.  What these worker protections are depend highly on what state you live in. IANAL: Nearly all states operate under At-Will employment laws.  Under these there are various protections to workers being fired for what is widely considered unfair reasons.  Of these common statutory unfair reasons are: for refusing to commit illegal acts – An employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal. family or medical leave – federal law permits most employees to take a leave of absence for specific family or medical problems. An employer is not permitted to fire an employee who takes family or medical leave for a reason outlined in the Family and Medical Leave Act. not following own termination procedures – often, the employee handbook or company policy outlines a procedure that must be followed before an employee is terminated. If the employer fires an employee without following this procedure, the employee may have a claim for wrongful termination. Most states have clauses offering additional protections to workers under Public Policy Doctrine.  What this means is that an employer cannot terminate you for retaliation of actions that comply with public policy.  An example of this would be if you reported your employer to the EPA for illegally disposing of toxic or regulated waste and you were let go because of it.  You would have a strong case to bring suit. *Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment * The bottom line is that despite all of this, determining wrongful termination is incredibly difficult to do, as most employers realize that they can best protect themselves legally by almost never terminating an employee with reason.  If they simply say that your services are no longer needed, then in most cases it is far too dificult to prove wrongful dismissal on the basis of race, gender, discrimination, or retaliation. So you have to determine yourself if you feel that what your employer did was illegal, because coming to a conclusion on unethical is far harder to prove.  Certainly illegal is unethical, but unethical isn't always illegal."
929,"Get help as soon as possible. In this sort of situation honesty  (with yourself and your employer) is the only way. Letting it fester is the worst thing to do, no job is worth that, especially when your health is at stake. With my experience of stress in the workplace I was luck enough to notice my symptoms early on and get help from my Doctor immediately, I was signed off for a couple of months and put on some mild medication to help 'level me out'. Thanks to spotting it and not letting it become an issue that could affect the company, my employer was grateful and incredibly supportive. I have since left the company on good terms and still have an on-going freelance relationship with them."
930,"Back in my consulting/contracting days the company had a simple rule - if you work, it goes on your timesheet.  If the client doesn't care to pay for your time, don't work it. If you're working and not getting paid for it you're effectively taking a pay cut.  Too often this is sort of a co-dependent thing - the boss gives subtle (or perhaps not-so-subtle) hints that extra time is appreciated/needed/required (choose your level of abuse :-) and people then pick up on this and start working over/extra.  If eight people each put in one hour of extra time per day, that pretty much saves the company from bringing in one more developer.  Hey, must be time for bonuses and parties all 'round, right? Wrong. What happens is more likely the following: Management learns that they can get something for nothing. Employees learn that they can get nothing for something.  Grumbles start. Management wants more (the old ""free milk and a cow"" thing, kinda :-). Employees get burned out. Employees bail, remainder are asked/nudged/pushed/expected to cover ""on a temporary basis""/""during our current crisis""/""for ever"". And the spiral continues downward... Working free overtime does neither you nor your employer any good in the long term.  If you're working for a ""short term benefit"" company do yourself a favor and move."
931,"In many US companies the trend over the last ten years is to move sick, vacation , and part of holiday pay into one pool of hours. Instead of 10 days vacation, 5 sick days, and 10 holidays. They are changing to 18 days of Paid Time off (PTO) and 7 holidays. The cost is the same but the accounting for the employee and company is easier. Some companies reduced the total number of days, but not all did. Most companies did change rollover and use-it-or-lose-it rules when they made the switch. Once the company made the switch employes no longer needed to lie about needing a mental health day. They still require documentation for longer absences to get your coverage under the short-term or long-term disability. Based on the symptoms, this seems like a longer term issue, you might start looking for a new employer."
932,"About 3 years ago I pushed myself until I did end up in the hospital. I had all the classic signs of a heart attack. I had a coworker take me to the ER where the Dr told me, luckily, I just had a stress induced panic attack, so I feel I have some understanding of this problem. When is it appropriate to take sick leave/vacation time do to work stress / fear of burnout? You should take it if you are thinking about how you feel stressed or that you are close to burning out. The fact of the matter is no job is worth pushing yourself to illness, physical or mental. You need to keep things in perspective and remember that the company you work for has no loyalty to you. Why would you push yourself to the point where you, physically or mentally collapse for them? More than likely if you end up reaching a point where you are unable to work for an extended time period due to illness they are going to replace you since you are no longer of an value to the company. You must be proactive in preventing yourself from reaching a point of high stress / burnout. How do you be proactive? Keep track of your stress levels. Get a small pocket year calendar and every day after work write down a number from 1-10 of your stress level for the day, 1 being none to 10 being when you experience physical symptons due to stress. When the numbers start getting high and staying high that's when you need to schedule vacation time. Something simple as taking the next two Fridays off can do wonders for helping you relax. Spend those days relaxing, no house work, no stress. Sleep in, go out to lunch, catch a silly movie, etc. Talk with your boss and keep him informed of your work situation and stress levels. Your boss should be open to having you communicate your feelings of your work environment. Most bosses like to feel useful and enjoy having employees come to them seeking advice, it inflates their ego. He might just end up being ok with pushing deadlines or getting you some help or finding other ways to lower your stress level. Walk away and find a less stressful job. It might mean switching careers or taking a pay cut but in the end you'll be much more happy and healthy and that's all that should be important to you. Remember that an important job title and big paycheck mean nothing when you're dead. Find an outlet to release the stress. Start a hobby, play video games, do a sport, meditate, join a gym or even get a weekly massage. Having a way to disconnect from work and do something you enjoy will work wonders for lowering stress levels. Make sure to make it a routine activity that you plan in advance to do. Saying you golf to relax doesn't do you any good if you don't actually get out there regularly and hit that ball. Seek professional help. There is nothing wrong with seeking a trained therapist to help you learn to manage and deal with your stress. Not all therapists specialize in stress management so you may need to search around to find one. Also most health insurance plans do cover therapy costs so there should be no worry about the expense."
933,"Even if there's nothing ""physically"" wrong with your body don't discount the magnitude and seriousness of emotional stress. It is as ""real"" as any disease and is fully capable of wrecking your career or worse. Stress also makes other bad things such as depression and chronic diseases more likely. Please find ways to address it for yourself even after getting out of that job. See also Robert Saplosky's fascinating book about the physiology of stress "" Why Zebra's don't get ulcers "" and his excellent talks and documentary ."
934,"Are you getting your work done on time? If so, kudos to you - you're much more efficient than those staying late. There's a massive difference between working smart and working hard - in fact, as a manager, I often look poorly at members of my team who have to stay and work late because they aren't as productive as they need to be - so, in short, unless there's an additional project at work that you want to put extra time in (or are staying because you've been specifically asked), don't fret - you're working right. As far as the timetracking piece goes - use it and track your time based on exactly what you've done - your efficiency will shine through, which will also look good."
935,"In general I favor not doing other tasks during meetings, if the meeting isn't important enough to you to pay attention, then you shouldn't be attending it. However in the case of a task that has been discussed or approved during the meeting, it is possible that you could delight someone by fixing it on the spot. For instance we have a client who is problematic at best. Often in a meeting, a discussion of some piece of data that got entered incorrectly (due to a bad client file or a data entry error on the part of the sales rep). Since they are located acoss the country, our meetings are teleconferences and I am at my desk. If I can fix something they bring up, I will make them happier. So when it is something really important (someone can't login for instance)that can be fixed in about 2 minutes or less, I will tell them that and excuse myself for that length of time while they discuss something that is not applicable to me (I can suggest they discuss X from the agenda). If the flow of the meeting would be disrupted by me excusing myself (and all agenda topics require my input), I wait until the meeting is done and then send out an email 5-10 minutes later showing the problem is fixed. Usually I tell them in the meeting that doing the fix won't take long and I will do it as soon as we are finished. This still delights them and isn't a rude indictment of my need not to pay attention."
936,"With due respect to the other answerers, I'm going to offer an alternative solution. Obviously, one problem with putting a religious title on your resume is that you may be discriminated against, whether consciously or sub-consciously.  You may also make HR or hiring managers uncomfortable. However, you indicate that your real love is for your weekend job as a clergyman, and I may suppose that it is an important part of your identity.  I see a very positive effect from putting your title on your resume: you help ensure a good fit between you and your team, which will be a good thing in the long run.  There is some upside to being upfront here. Instead, do this: Put your religious title on your resume if you feel strongly about it and you can ""afford it"" .  In other words -- don't be stupid and think that you won't be losing some job opportunities due to the title, but if you don't think the loss will be too great, put it.  This approach also applies to someone who has an ""alternative"" lifestyle and believes strongly in it as part of his or her identity."
937,"Is it unprofessional to do other stuff at work?. I'm a software developer. I work in an office from 8 to 5.30. There are some days when I have lots of code to write. Some days I don't have anything to do. At all. My boss is aware of this, so I start doing personal stuff like reading, browsing the web or even other projects. Does this sound ok to you? Am I ripping off the company?"
938,"Sometimes (especially when you are inexperienced or new to an organization) you need to ask something, not because you don't have a preference about what to do, but because you want to make sure that your preference is going to be OK with the organization or make sure you have the authority to do something. One thing I might do in this case is write an email that states the possibilities and the one I prefer and then adds the magic words: I know you are busy, so if I don't hear back from you differently by
  noon tomorrow, I will use Option 1. This has the advantage in that the person is fully informed and doesn't delay you much. Further if you have someone who consistently ignores you, it gives you political ammunition if you do something other than what they wanted, because you told them that no replying meant they agreed. It might even make the person start to actually read your emails when they get burned because you did something they didn't agree with and they couldn't be bothered to tell you so."
939,"No it doesn't sound OK. If you have nothing to do, I would be concerned. I have almost never known a software developer with nothing to do. That's a huge red-flag that your job is in danger. First have you told your boss you need more work? Have you made suggestions for work that can be done during an unavoidable delay (I can think of almost no code bases that couldn't use some more tests for instance), is there professional (not personal) reading that you can do? Are there other employees who are working overtime that you could offer to help? Are them some work-related projects that no one has has time to do. You know the boring stuff like clean up the code repository because somehow stuff has gotten put in multiple places, or make an application to make doing timesheets easier, or..."
940,"The only time I have ever personally seen a no from the phone screener turn into a yes later was when all the candidates who made it through the phone screen were rejected and then the phone screen was looked at more closely. this can be especially true if the phone screener was HR not technical. I have only known one person to get hired this way and I was the one who overrode the phone screen because it was clear from the candidates who passed it that I was not seeing the qualified people. But if you have qualified people to interview and one or more of them does well, there is no reason to look at who the phone screen rejected. However, the phone screener may say that while you aren't a fit for this job, you would be good for this other job and I have seen people interviewed (and hired) for a different job than the one they applied for. Sometimes it's for a job they haven't advertised yet. So a no on this job may not be a ""never consider this person for any other job"" rejection."
942,"The general term I use on reviews is ""Not a self-starter."" The technical term is "" Time Theft "". Generally, companies follow a strict hierarchy: You may have a board, then a president or multiple presidents, then the VPs... These are generally considered ""upper management""... Then you may have a lesser set of VPs, supervisors, team leads, etc. These are ""middle management"". All these sorts are management ; that is, they're directing the flow of work, delegating it to the workers. Unfortunately, there are always less executives than workers, which means that your supervisor isn't managing just you, but a group. By virtue of this, it is generally the managers responsibility to make the most of your time. However, they can not be expected to hold your hand and walk you through each and every moment of your day. You are paid for an 8 hour day with a 30-minute lunch break. Other than your lunch break (and 15 minute breaks as mandated by law, in some places), you are on company time. If you're doing nothing, you're earning nothing. Working on other projects can be good so long as the product of those projects advances the company. If you're working on company time, all products of that time have been purchased. That said, you may want to consider saving your personal projects for personal time. Use your common sense; if you're feeling guilty, there's a reason why. You belong working for the company when you're taking up company time. If they don't have work for you, take the day off to your mutual benefit – they don't have to pay you, and you can spend the time looking for a more productive job (After all, it's better to proactively search for employment than reactively find a new job after being sacked). Edit On consideration following @Chad's comments , I feel I should amend this post: While there could conceivably be a situation in which you are in a position at which you're paid a wage for which a general expectation of work quality exists which you're able to supply in fewer hours than allotted, this should not be construed as an invitation to cease productivity and rest on your laurels. Your question was 'Am I ripping off the company?"" and the answer is undeniably yes – you are billing them for time in which you are doing nothing to prove yourself as a valuable employee. Now, consider: Why do you work? When you took the job, you agreed to a salary for a given set of tasks for a fixed number of hours. Generally, a good manager will hire an employee to perform tasks in excess of the hours of a day at a set price, which guarantees an equitable exchange of productivity (over time) for the price. Therefore, in your proposed situation, one of two things occurs: The manager underestimated your capacity to handle work at that price (that is, the payment is a significant overvaluing of the workload). You underestimate the expectations of the manager for the quality of work to meet that value. So let's revisit the question: Why do you work? You work for money, a tool of exchange and the product of effort . Your job is not yours by entitlement , but by effort . Do you not expect when you visit a restaurant to be served not only in a timely manner, but at any time that you enter during business hours, in exchange for your money? Then you have no right to ask for anything without the exchange of effort. Recognize, then, that your highest virtue is your capacity to think , and ensure that you're offering equitable effort for your payment."
943,"I'd file this under be yourself .  Keep it neat enough that you don't offend anybody in your office (if you get comments on how messy your desk is, especially from a manager, you should probably clean it up a bit). Otherwise, be yourself .  Don't put on a ""show"" by being either neater or messier than you really are, because you won't be able to keep up that level of cleanliness (if you are naturally messy), or you will find it irksome to keep it ""messy"" if you are naturally neat. IMO it is really silly to think you can raise the esteem of your colleagues by ""being messy"" - try doing really good work instead."
944,"Software can always be improved.  Here are some things you could do when there is no immediate need for code: Automate any manual part of the build and deployment process. Automate any manual testing. Improve test coverage. Refactor any part of the code that is difficult to understand. Investigate new technology.  For example, if you are using Java, then look at Clojure or Groovy or Scala. Suggest improvements to your current products.  If you don't know enough about the users to do this, then learn. Prototype new features or products. I'm sure you can think of a few more."
945,"How do I adjust my workplace to reduce eye strain?. My vision is worse than average for software developers.  In addition to accuity (not the subject of this question), one problem I have is light-sensitivity.  I find that staring at a computer monitor all day with the standard Windows black-on-white scheme is painfully bright. I already have anti-glare treatment on my computer glasses (a special pair tuned for the monitor focal distance), and I've dialed down the brightness on my monitors (LCD) as far as it will go.  I've walked through the temperature-color settings on the monitor to find the combination that, to my uneducated eye, looks best, and I've walked through all the display settings in the Windows control panel, including the acessibility ones.  My opthalmologist is not technically savvy and does not have specific advice to offer (beyond the special glasses). Even so the screen was too bright (headache within the hour), so I switched to a reverse-video scheme (light tan on dark brown rather than white on black, which seems more comfortable).  This works well in general, but some applications and some web sites hard-wire colors that then don't work for me (for example, hard-wiring black text without setting a background color).  It seems I would be better off if I could switch back to a dark-on-light scheme (not necessarily black-on-white but something more muted), if I could figure out how to make it work. So my question is: with a dark-on-light color scheme, what strategies can I use to reduce the bombardment of light-colored pixels that hurts my eyes?  My desk is in a dark corner of an open-seating plan (though I have two full-height walls).  There are overhead fluorescents nearby but I've gotten the ones closest to my space turned off.  I am free to add any type of lamp and change my monitor settings.  I am not free to install new software (except via a long approval process that often ends with ""no"").  OS is Windows XP now, but answers for Windows 7 will also be welcome (we'll be moving to that).  I see flicker at 60Hz so avoid fluorescents. Trying every possible combination of {Windows control panel, monitor color/brightness, Windows color scheme, desk lamp} is combinatorically implausible, hence this question."
946,"Are you sure it's brightness?  I know a number of people that have issues with ""flicker"" causing headaches after an hour or so.  The headaches are usually in the cluster or migraine family which can significantly amplify light-sensitivity. There are multiple people in my office that swear by these glasses to prevent eyestrain and reduce headaches. Another former colleague of mine would have the fluorescent overhead lights use a green-tint lightbulb rather than the normal ones to reduce the impact of the flicker. Finally, it might be the refresh rate on your monitor.  Most likely your monitor is refreshing at a rate of 60 hertz.  For some very sensitive people, this is too slow.  You might see if you can somehow borrow or test out a monitor with a higher refresh rate. Do you encounter the same issue if you watch TV for an extended period of time?  What is the refresh rate on your television?"
947,"Job offer contingent on background check: when to give notice?. I have recently accepted a job offer from an employer (a relatively large one with big HR dept). Basically everything went fine: salary/benefits negotiated, start-date determined, etc. I got the letter, signed it, sent it back, and gave notice to my previous employer . However, according to the paperwork, the job offer is contingent on passing a pre-employment background check . I have always thought it was a formality but this time the background check is really happening and appears to be fairly extensive and is taking more than two weeks. For example, I had to take a drug test and I know they are verifying my past employment with a third party, checking my linkedIn profile, etc, and who knows what else. The HR department doesn't even know when the background check will be complete. There is no reason to believe that I won't pass the background screen and I have nothing to hide, but it makes me kind of nervous. What if something goes wrong for whatever reason and the offer is reneged? That would put me in a very vulnerable situation. In the future, should I refrain from giving notice to my previous employer until after the completion of the background check? The problem with that is that it could push out the start date because I expect to give a reasonable amount of notice to the previous employer. On the other hand, it sort-of provides an incentive for the background check to be done quickly."
948,"In general, I would say that the time to give notice is when you know 100% you will be working with the other employer. If the new job is contigent on something (such as a background check), don't give notice until it's done, because if something does turn up and they decide not to hire you because of it, you could find yourself either with no job, or begging for your old job back. And yes, it could push out the start date but it's only reasonable since they are pushing the lengthy background check."
949,"As I see it, you got assigned to do work for which you are not qualified (because you don't have that specialized degree) and you want to make sure that people understand this wasn't because you were having an affair with the boss or because you were the owner's nephew or something? OK first why did you get that position if you didn't have the normal qualifications? You might want to explain that in the cover letter. Are you expecting to continue in this field, if so are you pursuing the specialized degree? Why not, if you aren't? Having worked for someone who did get her job because she was sleeping with the CEO, I personally would be suspicious if I saw a resume like yours where you not only weren't qualified but left after a short period of time (looks like the affair ended or you genuinely couldn't do the work). You had better have a good up front explanation before I would be interested in hiring you.  However, luckily for you, many people have not had the ""joyful"" experience I described above and mostly they would want to know if you plan to get the degree (which they may see as a hard and fast requirement) and how well you did the work."
950,"To help your eyestrain you need to take your eyes off the screen in front of you and change your focus at regular intervals. Our sight works by detecting edges and movement and works best if our eyes are constantly looking at new things at different distances and in different light conditions. You don't have to do this every 10 minutes, but every hour (or so) you should turn away from the screen and look at something in the middle or far distance. If you can see a window from where you sit so much the better. Getting up and taking a walk will help - you can combine this with a toilet or coffee break. Get your eyes tested and if you need prescription lenses wear them. You might need to get a pair of glasses specifically for computer work. Changing these for your regular glasses (or no glasses) when you take your breaks is also a good idea. If you are still using a CRT monitor try to increase the refresh rate to 85Hz. This should eliminate the flicker. Better still would be to swap it for an LCD monitor that doesn't flicker. The ""computer"" glasses you see advertised don't really do anything other than tint the view and possibly magnify slightly. They are not a substitute for prescription lenses. For example, two of the major ""selling"" points from the ""Steelseries Scope"" site (which are no longer available at SteelSeries , though Gunnar still offer glasses with these ""technologies"") jump out at me: I-AMP® LENSES Enhance the properties of the human eye and its interaction with digital devices This is pure marketing speak and therefore meaningless. SHARPEN SIGHT Enhance details for sharper, clearer vision The lenses are slightly magnifying. If you don't need glasses this could end up causing eye-strain and headaches. Steer well clear."
952,"If I own a company, can I use my company email address on my resume?. I've read that it's not recommended to use a work email address on a resume, but if I own a company and have an email address under the company's domain, would it be appropriate to use that? Or should I still stick to a Gmail address? EDIT: This resume will be used to apply for contracting positions. The domain of the email address is that of a company under which my freelance work would be released and through which I would be hired."
954,"It's going to depend a lot on how your company and management feel about it. Some companies expect every minute accounted for. Others take a more flexible attitude. It's best when such time usage is formally stated, like Google's 20% rule . It also is of benefit to the company since it allows for training, new ideas and so forth. After all, software developers are creative people, not assembly line workers. Treating them like line workers, such as micromanaging with TPS reports, will tend to backfire. Without a formal guideline, it's quite possible to end up in the ""no work to do"" zone like HLGEM mentioned. This can lead you right out the door so you may want to find work you can do. Even then, your ""make work"" may not save your job. On the flip side, some companies like to keep key people more or less on retainer. They may not have a lot to do every single day but what they do accomplish when working more than makes up for the cost of the more or less unused hours. They'll also be expected to work extra time to get a project finished quickly."
955,"I would say it depends on the type of company you own. Would the email address look unprofessional for the jobs you are applying for? If not then use it. The big free email providers, gmail, hotmail, yahoo are all considered standard and a good choice. Personally, I believe everyone should attempt to obtain a personal domain and email. It's good branding strategy to have your own website."
956,"The common advice against using a ""work email"" is usually along the lines of ""You're using company resources to find a new job, and that's (probably) not kosher according to your company's internet use policy."" -- If your boss finds out (or IT finds out and rats you out), it could be very detrimental to your career. In your case, being that it's your domain, I don't personally see a problem with it, but be aware of two things: Your prospective employer will judge you by the image your company's site presents. john.doe@gmail.com doesn't stand out.  A domain they've never heard of does. Expect them to visit your site, and have a placeholder or something nice to look at. If your email breaks that's BAD. If GMail, Hotmail, or a big ISP has an outage, everyone knows it's not your fault. If your system blows up, you look bad; especially if you're applying for an IT job! Also pay attention to AlanBarber 's advice about making sure your email address looks/sounds professional.  I've seen some awful things that got an express trip to the shredder..."
958,"In my experience (within the US of A) using a company email address has all of the connotations that have already been mentioned, plus two that haven't been addressed: If you are currently self employed, but you are also searching for a job as an employee , you are by default giving mixed signals. Yes, transitioning from one method of acquiring currency to another method will be necessity have a period of transition. However, don't make it more confusing than it already has to be. A person seeing you use your company email address as a primary contact on a resume that is ostensibly to become an employee of another organization, may start to wonder ""Does this person intend to leave their own company? Are they really interested in working for someone else? What the dilly, yo?! "" Also note that if you currently run your own business and you are looking to settle into an employee position, your potential employer will be concerned that you will not do well with ""taking orders from someone else"" or ""not being your own boss anymore."" Anything you can do to remove any blatant reminders that you are currently self-employed is a good thing. If you are not self employed, and you use your current employer's email domain, you are throwing off an air of disrespect. It's basically two-timing your employer to be using their equipment to find another job. No matter how evil they are, don't use their equipment to find another job. Potential employers, at least ones that have decent emotional intelligence, will see that and pick up on it. ""If he can sneak around behind his current employer's back, he can do it to us. His character isn't strong. This cat be faker than a three dollah bill, holmes! "" Even if your current employer approves of you using your work email address (stranger things have happened), don't do it. The recipients don't know the situation and the time wasted on explaining that arrangement in an interview is wasting time reminding them that you are currently employed. You don't want that. Let us hear the end of the whole matter Go register a domain that includes your name in it. FirstnameLastname.com , FirstInitialLastName.me or something similar. I like .me or .info regardless of if the .com is available since it makes it obvious it's your personal domain. Set up a small, single page informational site on that domain that links to your LinkedIn account and has a downloadable resume on it. Include your name and current employment status. Use that domain as your email address for things like job hunting. That way people don't see your employment, they see you. And you're dang spiffy."
959,"Should I take an related-but-not-ideal job with a company in hopes of moving into my ideal job?. My last job was doing application programming with a bit of web design for a software company. I left that job, and now have a job offer from a larger software company to do web design. I love application programming and web design is not my ideal job, however the company did say it's possible (but not guaranteed) that in the near future they may give me work in application programming as well. I am trying to determine if I should take the web-design job based on what they have said. Is it a good idea to take a related, but not ideal job in hopes of moving onto my ideal job? And can you suggest any questions I could ask the company to help me make this decision?"
960,"Should I put blog links or public profiles like LinkedIn or StackOverflow in my resume?. When should I put blog links, or links to public profiles such as LinkedIn, StackOverflow (or other SE sites), Facebook, Twitter, etc on my resume? Or is this a bad idea entirely that will make my resume look unprofessional?"
961,"In the future, should I refrain from giving notice to my previous employer until after the completion of the background check? YES! Until the contingencies are released, you should not give notice. The new employer is setting the conditions ... they won't finalize the offer until after the background check clears. Make clear to HR and the hiring manager that you will give professional notice once the offer is finalized. When they press you for a start date, repeat ""the Monday 2 weeks after the offer is finalized."""
962,"Professional sites References like LinkedIn and other such sites are actually good to put. HR can also make independent reference checks, people see recommendations (which generally cannot be put in the resume) etc. However, this can backfire if you have made gross incorrect mis-representations in these profiles and there is a gap between the profile and the resume. Stack Exchange (I guess there are no similar) This could be good. Specially if someone really knows about the concepts here. If recruiter goes through your questions or answers it might help make judgement about your ability; something resume cannot make it explicit. Personal sites, blogging etc. Here a recruiter will be interested depending on the content. For example, if you are a programmer, and if you are blogging about programming it helps me understand your depth. But if the blog is about social issue, from your blog one can make out your thoughts. In some professions it might be relevant but not others. It really depends only on the content when it is really meaningful. Facebook, Twitter Usually this is very personal. As a recruiter I really won't bother about last summer's party pics on Facebook. Or what is on your #now-playing-list on Twitter. There is nothing much I get here. So no big deal. In general, all this help on the resume. But definitely doesn't harm unless you are too uncomfortable with privacy loss. Remember in all cases, once it attracts you to interview or other evaluation process, much of this is really makes no big deal after that."
963,Only include anything on your CV if it adds value and shows competency in the field your working in. So for example as an engineer your blog about Algerian cat breeding wouldn't add value and shouldn't be included but a blog about engines would.
964,The answer depends if your current employer knows you are looking for a new job. Its reasonable to assume most background checks will involve calling your current employer. If the first they hear about your job hunt is a reference call then its likely to reflect badly on you. If they know then you can wait till you get the green light.
965,"Unless you're doing government/military work, the primary purpose of a background check like this is to ensure that a) You don't have outstanding warrants or a criminal record, b) You are who you purport to be (you went to school where you said you did, you worked where you said you did, etc.) They're not checking whether you dated a communist when you were in college.  Although I agree with the other posters that it's best to wait until all of this is done (because who knows how long it will take), in reality, your risk in giving notice or at least a head's up to your current boss is minimal."
966,"One thing no-one else has mentioned: keep your glasses scrupulously clean . I find that if my glasses are even slightly dirty, for instance a single light fingerprint, I start getting eye-strain much more quickly. I usually clean my glasses by washing them in soapy water, and then drying them with either a previously unused tissue or a lint free cloth. The important thing is to remove any trace of dust or grease that could cause vision to be blurred or tempt the eye to refocus on the glasses lens itself. The reason I wash with soapy water is that it's the only practical way to actually remove the grease rather than just spread it around. Typical glasses cleaning cloths usually just soak up grease for the first few days but after that they start to deposit it back on the glasses, so I have never found them useful. My levels of eye strain also reduced significantly when I started taking the advice of the UK Health and Safety Executive advice and positioned my monitor such that the top of my monitor was at eye level ( Working with VDUs 740k pdf). This left my monitors at a much steeper angle (rather than angled up, with me looking down on it), resulting in fewer reflections from behind me and this also completely eliminated reflections of ceiling lights. Few monitors have enough height adjustment to allow this without a monitor stand, but getting this right is well worth the investment. You may also find that if your current LCD display has a gloss coating , then a matt coating might suit you better. Matt screens are often criticised for not being as bright or as vibrant, but they can eliminate or at least substantially reduce reflections which will be even more of a problem if you generally use a dark background. Also, a high quality screen with a wider brightness range, a high contrast ratio, and better black levels at low brightness could allow you to create a more comfortable workstation. Plus, if you argue that it will increase your productivity, then business case of a more expensive monitor should be fairly straightforward. Finally, make sure your glasses prescription is up to date. Nothing will give you eye-strain more quickly than an out of date prescription. I would rather have replacement lenses every year than a new designer frame every other year and in the UK all VDU workers are entitled to claim the cost of one eye test per year from their employer."
968,"When someone corresponds with me with an email address that is from a company, my initial reaction is that this person is: He is not aware of simple confidentiality protocol by revealing who he is working for at the moment. Remember that I don't have any idea that he owns the company. This would have to be make clear in the initial contact. He wants to come on board as a consultant or contractor. He is looking for jobs during his worktime, do I want someone like this on my team? I suggest that getting a gmail, hotmail, yahoo or even one from your local ISP."
969,"There is short term and long term. Taking a few days off to alleviate some stress is usually a good remedy if the stressful situation is temporary . The way you describe it, your situation is anything but. 1 year of 1/10 satisfaction, as you put it, sounds like a permanent state of extreme dissatisfaction. So, by all means, you should take time off if you feel that your are about to keel over. By your description, it sounds like you might already have but you have yet to acknowledge it so a trip to the doctor should be in your future and probably more than just a couple of days to rest up. But, you should reflect on what it is that causes your stress and why your work gives you such little satisfaction. Sick-leave will prevent you from going mad or having a heart-attack but it won't improve your work-satisfaction in itself. Try to stay constructive, consider what changes to your situation, environment and tasks would make you happier at work. Then discuss this with your boss and see if you can put a plan together for you. Also take a long hard look at your job and decide if you can continue with it under the present circumstances. I understand that quitting and finding a new job is not possible for everyone and I don't know your situation. A lot of people, though, torture themselves in crappy jobs when they really don't have to. Life's too short to spend 50% of it miserable."
970,"This process is seriously broken, and it's not your fault .   It is absurd to put code into production with no review of any kind.  Ideally the change should be reviewed, and a full regression test should be run. If time is critical, then the absolute minimum would be for two developers to agree on the fix.  In such cases, management should understand that there is a significant chance (> 1%) that the fix will fail. You weren't trained, and you don't have authority over the code that is in production, or the deployment process.  Never take responsibility when you don't have authority.  Explain what you were asked to do, and how you responded.  A rational response by management would be to analyze the incident, then modify the process to prevent future occurrences.  Anything else is irrational.  Do not stay in irrational organizations."
971,"In the US:
The answer is when you are comfortable with the risk of not getting the new position and being out of work should the position fall through. Unless you have a contract, until you reach the point where you have started, the new position can fall through.  You may have some recourse once the official offer has been extended but there are many valid reasons that will make that recourse effectively moot.  Then in the first part of your employment the employer can terminate you with little real recourse. If you leave your original company on good terms you can probably return with little fuss.  This can be a bit humbling but generally your knowledge and skills are valuable enough that you can return and provide value immediately.  This makes you less of a risk than a new employee.  Because of this many times an employer will take you back if they still have positions open."
972,"What are some good resources for improving communication skills?. I am not as good at communicating with others as I'd like to be. I'm sure many other software geeks and introverts have some difficulty here. Are there any good resources out there? Either blogs or books or just little tips that make things easier when trying to communicate ideas with coworkers. I'll spend a while writing a nice email that I feel like nobody actually reads or I'll miss the point of an email I'm reading. I get into IM conversations and we end up spending hours going back and forth. On phone calls I'll get asked something that I need more time to process and I lock up. In other cases when I know what I'm talking about I try to explain what is in my head, but if they don't grasp the idea immediately I'm stuck just repeating myself and hoping that it will eventually make sense to them. It feels like it takes a lot more of my time and energy than it should to communicate even simple ideas. Maybe that's just the way it is and it takes more practice. But I would welcome any tips that make the process smoother or easier."
973,"Should I include short work experience on my CV?. After only three weeks from the day I left my previous job I have been invited by this company to join their team. I accepted the invitation right away, but now three other weeks have passed and, for a number of reasons, I don't feel neither comfortable nor satisfied enough with my choice. I would like to start looking for a new job again, but I don't know whether it will be beneficial or not to include this 3-week-long experience in my CV. The truth is that in these three weeks I learned a lot of new things about Java (which is most certainly what I will be applying for anywhere else), but I am afraid that ""stating"" in the CV that I want to leave a company I joined just the other day will give a bad image about myself. How should I deal with my current position in my CV?"
974,"Resume where you are listing your projects or key results - there won't be much about this part of the job. Also, generally ""learning a lot through reading"" is usually not placed much in resume unless you have gained practical work experience in that area. (it's ok to put Java as part of skill set). However, when you are putting down the chronology of companies you have been to, it is very essential that you do not omit any organization attended. Usually, a period like 3 weeks one could ignore when evaluating and no one will come to know about it; however, if they come to know about this relation during ref check - it leaves a bad remark as to why you hide this fact. And during interviews where one would ask you why did you changed so quickly? If you had genuine reasons to leave people wont mind it. But in the above stated situation no one might cross check with you. You might be at loss. So as a general rule never hide that you have attended a company even
  for a small while."
975,"It sounds like you need something a little bit more powerful than the Windows color schemes tool (basically something that intercepts the whole graphics stream at the video card and tweaks it)? A little googling lead me to PowerStrip , which seems to be able to tweak color curves and gamma globally.  It might be able to help you out with taming the stray pixels that Windows isn't catching. Caveat: I'm a Mac/Unix guy - I know nothing about this software except what I read in this forum thread and on the manufacturer's site, so while it looks promising it's equally possible I'm talking out my behind."
976,Short answer is no. Working for only 3 weeks in a permanent position would be a red flag to a potential employer (it indicates you could have been sacked). Career gaps are an even bigger red flag but nobody will notice just three weeks so your safe to omit it. I suggest you do a pet project that uses the skills you talk about. You can then demonstrate your new skills without detracting from your cv
977,"I'm not sure that it's the answer you're looking for, but the real answer is simply ""practice"". Regardless of what aspect of communication I'm trying to improve - presenting, technical writing, answering questions concisely, negotiation and problem resolution - you can do all of the reading of techniques and practices and methods that you want. But the one thing that I've always seen in every book or mentioned in every training course or seminar is that you need to take these ideas and practice them on a regular basis to integrate them into your life and continue to improve them. As far as resources go, most of what I'm familiar with deals with specific aspects of communication and not a general purpose guide to communication. In terms of having a conversation, I would suspect something like Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most might be a good starter, and you might be able to apply the concepts to writing, but it doesn't go into presenting, meetings, or writing specifically and focuses on one-to-one communication. I suspect ""communication"" is just too broad for a reasonably-sized book. The only other suggestion that I can make is to prepare. If you're writing an email, make it something that you would read if you got it and be sure read it just as if you received it to put yourself in the place of the recipient. If you're reading an email, read it more than once before responding. If you're presenting, do a dry run with other people present to provide feedback. If you're going to be answering questions, brush up and even if you don't know the answer, know where the answer is contained or who would be the best point of contact. If you're resolving a problem, try to go in knowing as much about the situation as you can from all angles."
978,"One popular book is How to Win Friends and Influence People . In the US, there is an organization called Toastmasters which helps develop public-speaking skills.  Joining a local chapter or another public-speaking club can really help you in expressing ideas and getting your point across. You also mentioned missing the point of an email.  You need to ask yourself, ""What is being said here?""  If you can't answer that for yourself, you can always reply back with a clarifying question.  It's never dumb to ask a question (that you can't answer yourself)"
979,"I would list this in my resume and continue to search. The reasons, it leave a positive impact that you have a job and you are looking. You are not comfortable with it is understable by any employer. Just one bad case does not leave you in bad water. If you have a history of such short tenures then you might have a problem and you want to think again. Employers will look at this as positive thing, unless something's wrong with the company, you are not really proud of it and you dont want to associate yourself with it. In that case it is your personnel choice."
980,"Here are two simple things that have helped me a lot in workplace communications. These are ""meeting"" related, but provide excellent practice for all forms of communication: Before you have any type of meeting with one or more people, prepare an agenda. Just list the main items you want to cover and the most important points. During the meeting, take notes and make sure that each item on the agenda is covered. Be mindful of the agenda if the discussion starts skidding off-track. Explicitly write down any ""action-items"" or obligations that result from the discussion. After the meeting, email everybody a very brief re-cap or summary of what was discussed, what conclusions were reached and what action-items are expected from each person. Doing these simple things easily put you far above average as far as effective workplace communication goes. The hard part is making your writing effective. Writing is a skill that can be improved almost without limit even by the most introverted personalities. Two books that are the writer's ""equivalent"" of K&R and H&S are On Writing Well and The Elements of Style . I can't recommend them enough."
981,"If you have regular reviews in your organization then that would be the appropriate time and place to ask the boss directly if there really is an unwritten 'face time' policy. If not, then then just meet the boss in private and ask the question in a frank and professional manner.  Don't be emotional, don't talk about 'feelings'. Just ask if he's OK with your work routine or not."
982,"Does keeping one's desk extremely clean appear lazy? Generally, this appearance isn't simply about the cleanliness of your desk, but how it in conjunction with your overall behavior reflects upon you in the atmosphere. There are, generally, 2 reasons that your desk would be exceptionally clean: General fastidiousness, in which case the absence of clutter makes for a more productive employee. Poor utilization, in which enough work is not making its way across your desk at a given time to make the best use of your abilities (This is not necessarily your fault). General fastidiousness can reflect well upon you so long as those exacting standards do not extend outside your acceptable sphere of influence (i.e. beyond your subordinates, if any). This can show that you have extremely high standards, but it requires that your productivity reflect this as well. Poor utilization can be either on your manager, in which case he's simply not passing an appropriate amount of work onto your shoulders, which is inefficient for all involved; or it can be that you like to be part of what we in my office call ""the clean desk squad"" – the people who attempt to get everything off their desk quickly to get back to watching their internet aquarium parks produce fish or farms grow crops. If there's a chance that you fall into this latter category, beware! Your days are numbered. Appearances Are Everything You're smart; I can tell this by the way you phrased your question: ""Does keeping one's desk extremely clean appear lazy?"" You know that appearances are important, and that they reflect upon you and your capabilities. Ways to appear busy despite your immaculate desk can be: When your supervisor comes in, ask them for feedback on your current progress on the project. You're demonstrating that not only are you busy, but you're making progress. Make use of the empty space effectively. A single notepad with hand written notes may be far less than other people have on their desk, but the appearance of notes and logs makes you appear to have something occupying your time. Just make sure they're actually notes about your current project! RFC . Interact with others on your team regularly about what's going on in your current project; make sure you know their progress and they know yours. This way, you can say, ""Oh, XYZ? John was handling that last week. He said ABC and thought he'd be on to MNO by Tuesday."" Email, conversations, or messaging can keep you connected and in the know. When something is on your desk, keep it orderly! Appearances aren't just about the moment, but about the moment in relation to the big picture. Show that it's a fastidious nature that drives you to be organized by keeping the papers you do receive stacked and ordered, not splayed out (The latter being a common indicator of a Clean Desk Squad member). Being an employee is about managing expectations. We manage expectations by delivering appearances. So long as you deliver the right appearances, you shouldn't have any troubles about your clean desk."
983,"Here a few other ways to approach this: Emotional Intelligence 2.0 - Granted this is a bit broader as it covers self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship building, the tools may still prove useful within communications to some degree as you may be giving mixed messages at times, e.g. some people may mistake silence for disapproval when really one may just be thinking something through thoroughly. The Introvert Advantage - For something aimed a bit more directly at an introvert.  There are likely other books aimed at Introverts though another side to this is to consider how well do people already get that you may not be the quickest to reply on some things. Last but not least would be to look at various strengths tools like StrengthsFinder or Standout to see what strengths do you have and then using that as a frame of reference communications things may shift a bit.  For example, a goal-oriented person with a strong Achiever or Pioneer strength may view relationships from the perspective of having a check list that they use to maintain contact rather than just talk to people whenever it feels appropriate."
984,"Being an effective communicator is about... Communicating . Establish Authority Use words they understand. Break it into small bits. Be confident in your address. I am not a great communicator. I am terrified of crowds, have a stutter brought on by years of being talked over by my father and brother, and threw up all over myself the very first time I was in a play. So what right do I have to give you advice for improving communication skills? I was a relatively successful magician and mind reader. When I was in high school I dabbled in little tricks, card cheating, and picking pockets and the like. I would do a bit here and there for the amusement of my friends, but had little performance skill. I went to university in Las Vegas and had the wonderful fortune to take a class from Looy Simonoff (whom I'm sad to say I just found out passed away last June), who was a wonderful talent and a great mentor. When I asked him how he could stand in front of people and show them something that they know is fake and still have his wonderful confidence, he said something so simple that it made perfect sense: ""I do it."" The key to improving your communication skills is simple: Communicate . Get out, walk up to people and introduce yourself. Tell them about yourself and they'll tell you about them. Make a mistake, insult someone you don't know and will never see again, and then walk away. Then do it to a crowd. Then do it on stage. Whatever you're going to say, say it with confidence. I gave a speech once to a group of insurance agents about selling yourself. Here I was in my early 20s standing up in front of a room of 50 people who knew: I made a living performing mind-reading and hypnosis magic. I had sold myself as the speaker for the event. Between you and me (and anyone else reading this), I told them the biggest load of malarky you've ever heard. I made $500 for a one hour speaking engagement about selling yourself and I had no idea what I was talking about. I told them all about relationships between customers and their agents; I told them to forget about the company and to sell themselves as the company, using words like ""I"" and ""Me"" whenever they were talking about the insurance service. I could have told them to give their customers chocolate cake and a glass of milk and they'd have believed me. Eventually you're going to find it doesn't matter what you say so long as you break it down into something they can understand and you tell them it with absolute unshakeable confidence. That is: Establish Authority Use words they understand. Break it into small bits. Be confident in your address. With messages and emails, you have to remember that people skim emails . If it's important, speak to them directly. The hierarchy of communication is: Face-to-Face » Phone » Written Consider your message, and pick the appropriate format. Remember, no matter what method you pick to transmit your message, keep this in mind: Establish Authority Use words they understand. Break it into small bits. Be confident in your address."
985,First you should approach your current manager about your concerns.  They have invested time and money in bringing you up to speed.  If they are at least aware you are looking for a new position then you are more likely to get a positive reference. Second for a CV I would list the position always. A CV is about your complete experience and should be all inclusive.  A resume on the other hand is about what experience you have that is important to the position you are applying for now.  For a Resume I would list the position as my current position but I would likely drop the position from my resume afterwards.   After 6 months or so those few weeks you spent there are no longer important enough to list unless you made a major contribution or received an award while you were there.
987,"How should I respond to interview requests in my first month+ of a new job?. I've been working with a company for only one month, and I've received ongoing interest - such as requests for interviews - from resumes I sent out before I started my new position. How should I respond to these interview requests?  Is it a bad idea to take the interview?  What would be the risks and/or tradeoffs?"
988,"How would you respond to the request normally? There isn't much different at a new job except the following: You may still be in a probation period. You don't really know a lot about your new job yet (good or bad) so it will be hard to make any judgments about whether you should be considering different opportunities. Responding may make you look flaky (unreliable, careless, prone to changing your mind) to the other company, and to your new one if they find out. By ""not much different"" I mean you should only consider taking the interview request if there is a good reason to: The opportunity is/could be better You are unhappy in the current position Any other reason you might leave a company If you decide to decline, you should simply say ""I've already taken a new position, but thank you for your response.""  And, if you'd like them to retain your resume for the future, say so."
989,"First you need to make a personal choice: Do you want to leave your current employer, or not? If you have no desire to leave simply tell the recruiters (politely!) that you are sorry, but you recently came to work for a new employer, you are happy where you are, and you are not currently looking to change employment. Make sure to be polite - You may decide later on that you do want to interview with this other company, and you don't want to burn your bridges. If you do want to leave your current employer, respond as you would to any interview request when you're seeking employment (schedule an interview, talk to them, get an offer, etc.) -- Be aware however that a history of serial short-term employment may not look great on a resume."
990,"If you didn't intend to leave your current job, or the new opportunity looks flying sexy, it is a waste of time of everyone to attend the interview. If you want to decline the interview, you can say, ""Well, I was looking for a job and might have been interested in a
  position like this, but I have just taken up another assignment so I'm
  not be willing change very soon."" I think this (just-joined-somewhere) is enough, for recruiter not to bother you."
991,"How do I help a non-technical boss understand my work?. My boss is a journalist, and I am a web developer. He thinks I am late on the project, and he doesn't appreciate the effort I have spent. He wants quick and complete service.  He is not easy to communicate with about my work — once he has an opinion, it is difficult to change it. How do I help my boss understand the nature of my project when it is not his job role? Specifically, I have trouble communicating the cost of requirement changes and other tasks he asks us for."
992,"Can I give my resume personally to an employer if I already sent it to HR?. Is it a good idea to knock at an employer's door to personally hand a physical copy of one's resume to its HR department, even after sending it electronically through the ""official"" way? I think it could leave the impression that you are really interested in getting an interview at that particular place, but can this practice also be frowned upon?"
993,"Treat him at the level of customer. Like bosses, most customers also tend to be less technical as well; and at times, even if they have some background, they might want to avoid technicality. Every communication thus needs a little more perspective and details from overall view. In a way start from a 50,000 feet view and add detail as you go down - till the point he is sufficiently happy to know. So in all this is a problem of structured communication. This structured communication implies: getting them to know overall elements of the system and how they work, getting then to appreciate a general process that goes in development of such systems. when you are stuck in some problem, you need to give them some background and how you are planning to solve them. They should also know what remains essentially straight forward but common situation and what remains essentially non-solvable problems. In all cases, whatever you say, should make sense to them and should never sound like excuse (in the guise of technicality) The essence is, how do you translate most of your issues and status in a layman language, there will be improved communication and learning; and when people begin to understand stuff, they tend to listen better and increase the appetite to dig more or at least trust you that you are on your way to get things right. All that sounds like more work, but that's what you need to pay for having such a boss."
994,Its a bad idea. By doing it in person your just increasing their workload and refusing to use the recruitment procedure they set. Imagine if all the applicants handed everything in person?
995,"I can only speak for myself but as someone who handles about 10 interviews a month, I wouldn't appreciate the gesture. That's mainly because I'm pretty much busy all the time (most people that do interviews ARE busy from what I observe) and we already have a working procedure in place. These set procedures let us schedule ourselves so we can devote the appropriate amount of time to interviewing without disrupting our flow. Ever notice how HR always seems to arrange for multiple interviews in one day? It's easier to schedule. In fact, I've just told my HR to NEVER route these visits to me just in case :P"
997,"I read an advice from an article, 
that is recommended to have an interview every six months or year even if you are enrolled, that would help to understand what new things managers care about, or what skills are more important currently,"
998,"First things first: you don't get paid for effort, you get paid for results. What it sounds like here is a case of expectations management. I think your boss understands the nature of your project just fine, it's just that his perspective is a bit different than yours and you need to understand his perspective as much (or even more) as he needs to understand yours. Likely as not, your boss cares less about the implementation and technical aspects of your work than the results you can produce and how they work to further his business goals. So that is how you should communicate with him. Make it clear that you have a limited capacity to deliver, bounded by the number of working hours each day. Whatever requests he makes, establish scope, estimate the cost (how much time) and ask him to prioritize against other requests. Based on that, you can make predictions on when you will be able to deliver what. Never agree to do anything or commit to any delivery schedule until you are in agreement about scope, cost and prioritization."
999,"It depends on the company that you are applying to. For the large company, I would think that this is highly frowned upon. They have a pretty large pool of candidates to shift through, and having someone dropping their resume in would be a disruption to their process. The logistics of dealing with a paper copy of your resume would also be frowned upon by these HR folks. For a smaller company or startups, I would think that this is highly favourable. It shows initiative and out-of-box thinking on getting notice and a foot in the door. The smaller company are also more agile and able to handle this type of interruptions better than the larger docile companies."
1001,"This depends highly on the business you're in. A chef, for example, seems to follow a career arc that starts with visiting in person to hand over a resume and needs to rise pretty far up before an email or other electronic communication could start the ball rolling, even in a large establishment. Most office jobs involve a more ""hands-off"" application process, and that's what I'm familiar with. I've hired dozens of people myself, and advised clients during the hiring process (most recently a month ago) and these days, we get too many applicants. If you can't follow instructions, I don't even read your resume. I know that's harsh but it's true. So if I ask for emailed resumes and I get a comment on a blog post with a link to an online resume, or a twitter dm, or a phone call, or a visit - thanks for playing but you didn't follow the instructions. Now if you followed the instructions and emailed the resume, but then decided to do some extra thing to make sure that I gave your resume all the consideration it deserved, then I would think twice about hiring someone who doesn't mind interrupting my work to make sure they get what they want. I know books and articles are full of advice to ""stand out from the crowd"" and ""put in a little effort to show them you're a go-getter who really wants the job"" but trust me, it's a short distance from there to ""that annoying guy who thinks all I have to do all day is reassure him on the status of his application"" or ""that desparate guy who pulls tricks to get his resume read - he's probably not that good"". Be good at what you do. Build a resume that shows it. Stand out from the crowd by doing things all the time, not just while you're applying for jobs, and do things that help the world, not things that inconvenience hiring managers like visiting them at the office without an appointment. Join a user group, a professional association, and the like. Volunteer evenings and weekends doing something (related to your profession) for a non profit. Blog. These are not stunts, they don't look desparate, and they will make you genuinely better, which visiting people's offices will not."
1002,"I am myself a junior software engineer working in a video game company. When I applied, I personally handed a physical copy of my CV and a CD containing several of my projects. After a bunch of interview and tests I got the job. The HR guy told me afterward that my CV stood out because it was rare for him to receive a physical one. So I guess it depends on the company."
1003,"I'm reading comments and answers and I have to confess, I'm a bit flabbergasted. Since when is having people show up on time ""loss of a perk""? Since when is flex-time not having to care about the impact of your actions on the rest of the team and company? From what I read in the question and comments, the behavior of his team-members is provably detrimental and costly to the company. And after trying to reason and compromise, the situation has not improved (and btw, 9.30 is not early or in any way unreasonable). Explain to your team that you have no problem with flex-time, but that it implies a certain amount of personal responsibility to make sure your flexing is not impacting the work of others (on your team or other teams). As your team is clearly failing on the responsibility part, I would say that effective immediately and until further notice, all flex-time has to be approved by you beforehand. Failure to show up on time in the morning without approval or a reasonable excuse (no, alarm-clock did not go off is not acceptable) will result in disciplinary action like docking pay or vacation time. Be very clear why this is happening and what has forced you to take these measures. Point out that this is not something you want to do, but something that you have been forced to do. Also be clear that these restrictive policies can be lifted once the situation improves."
1005,"Communicating to get results really boils down to one simple principle - Hone your message done to what the listener is going to hear.  This has been expressed in several ways by several great books, but here are few ways of seeing this principle at work: (Stephen Covey / St. Francis before him) Seek to understand as much as to be understood (Dale Carnegie - How to Win Friends & Influence People) The key to influence to convince the other person that you understand them.  The easiest technique to do this is ""mirroring."" Pick up on their likes, their dreams, their needs, and connect with those things by revealing in your manner and speech the same things you have in you. Begin with the end in mind Keep the Main thing the Main thing Remove everything that can be removed, but nothing more.  (Put another way, the mind cannot secure what the butt cannot endure) (Bryan Chapell) Every point in an argument is either Explanation, Illustration, or Application.  Everything else is irrelevant.  Think of it this way: Express your point as no more than one sentence (a thesis). Then, for any detail, any point, any background information in your communication, ask this question.  What is the relationship of this sentence to my point.  Remember that in war, long supply lines are the most dangerous thing you can have.  If the route from your thesis to this sentence is long, it will be attacked, destroyed, and forgotten.) The famous preacher John Wesley used to practice his sermons on 4 year olds. If they could get it, anyone could get it.  I'm not saying your emails should be written to four year olds - but if you are going to introduce any concept (even say 'polymorphic inheritance') make sure to restate it in a way that doesn't require a degree to understand it. (e.g. 'This object in my code can use functionality from other objects that are more general forms of this one - and more specifically, from more than one object.') Again, in each of these things, the point of effective communication is this simple - Focus on the recipient, not yourself. The best communication has a hint of yourself but is made concrete in a way that says ""You are the most important recipient of this."""
1006,"Security clearance jobs: will security make it hard to get work done?. In many government or defense contractor jobs, some level of security clearance is required because the work is supposed to be ""secret"". In other words, employees aren't allowed to talk about what they do with anyone . This makes it hard for an outsider to assess the true nature of a workplace with clearance requirements. I have been thinking about finding work in places that require security clearance. Technically some of work appears very interesting, but I have concerns about whether such a job will have such onerous security that it becomes miserable because I won't have access to the resources I need to do my job. Specifically, I would like to know from others who have held security jobs, how draconian is security as far as getting work done ? Specifically: Will I be able to ""google"" for information or can I expect the
network to be completely locked down to the outside? How ""good"" are internal sources for reference information? (If I can't use outside resources) From what I understand, going through the security clearance process is very invasive, time-consuming and iffy as far as actually being granted clearance. It would be profoundly disappointing to go through all that and then end-up in a miserable ""top-secret"" place."
1007,"My first job after university was for a defence contractor. I moved on after a few years because even though I was working on defence systems rather than offence systems, I decided that it conflicted too much with my moral stance. This side of things is a personal decision that only you can answer. When I moved into the commercial sector, there was little difference. Work I did was covered under Non disclosure agreements rather than under The Official Secrets Act but the onus on me was still to keep the confidences of my employer with regard to my work. In either environment I could talk about how I was treated, complain about tight schedules, and bemoan (in non specific terms) customers changing their specifications all of the time, and in neither environment could I talk about who my customer was or what I was helping to build for them. Anywhere with serious security concerns will have specific policies to address those concerns. Whether you are working on missile guidance systems or anti-virus software, there may be some networks with no connection to the Internet. You may even have to work inside a TEMPEST hardened vault, where you are searched for phones/memory sticks before you are allowed entry. In a commercial environment though, you could easily be stuck in a back room or basement with no natural light and a proxy server set up by a BOFH . Alternatively, you may just have a desk with a multiple computers, and an air-gap between them, so all you have to do to switch from a secure network computer to internet capable computer is to swing from one keyboard to another. Sure, you lose being able to copy/paste between them (compared to using a VPN to access a more secure network) but it doesn't impact on productivity that much. Ultimately, a security vetted job is not really any different to any other job, it's just that the priorities and consequences can be rather different. If you don't think you can cope with it ethically, steer clear, otherwise keep your nose clean and you could get to work on some interesting and unique projects."
1008,"I have a security clearance.  Actual classified work is done on a segregated network (not connected to the internet), in rooms with special security provisions. However , most work is not actually classified.  We do our work (developing software) in a regular office environment, and if we need access to classified data we go to the lab. Most large companies have some IT restrictions; you are likely to find sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Blogspot blocked.  However, that has nothing to do with security clearances. If you interview at a company that requires a security clearance, the odds are very good that they will still be able to talk to you about the work in enough detail for you to decide whether you want to work there.  Not everything that happens at such a company is classified. If the entire facility is classified (it's one big class-lab), you won't be able to go through the door without a clearance."
1009,"A vast majority of companies have receptionists.  One of their primary purposes is to prevent people who do not have appointments from interrupting the work day for their employees.  Most of the time the receptionist will accept your resume, but rarely are they consulted on the quality of the candidate.  Not to mention if the offices at all busy then the receptionist may have taken little to no notice of you. Almost everyone has a computer on their desk today.  Many have laptops or tablets they are using to do their work.  It is much easier organize and review resumes when they are in a digital format.  Many companies have a website to apply online.  This will often put your resume into the system where candidates are selected from automatically.  Anytime you can make the HR persons job easier you are generally better off.  When you make them do extra work you run the risk or souring their attitude towards you, or even forgetting to enter you into the system all together. When you should personally hand in a resume When you go in to an interview have several of your resume in a portfolio.  If any one does not have one and is looking over someone else's shoulder or asking about it, offer them one you brought with you.  It is a great opportunity to make eye contact and get a smile from the interviewer.  I have had this technique turn a sour room friendly.  And it marks you as someone that comes prepared for important meetings, that is something the interviewers will probably respect. If you know the person you are going to be giving the resume too. It is not about who you know, its about what you know right... not really.  If you know someone at the company and they ask you to bring them your resume do it.  Personal references are really only important when they are employed by the company you are working for.  But when you have someone on the inside advocating for you it can increase your chances of at least getting an interview.  Many times it will get you in doors that would otherwise not even consider you. You should not give your resume to someone in person unless they have asked you to.  Ask your contact if they would prefer a physical resume or the digital version.  They are going to know the best way for them to advocate for you.  Help them out."
1010,"Let's start from the beginning. Just to set the stage, with the exception of a TA position that I held in college, every job (summer job, co-op, internship, full-time position) I've ever had has been in the defense industry, either as a government civilian employee or at a defense contractor. In addition, I've only applied to one job outside of the defense/intelligence sector. I'm planning on spending my entire career in this industry. The notion that employers aren't allowed to talk about what they do is incorrect. I was a candidate for a position at a Department of Defense intelligence agency that specializes in signals intelligence, the protection of US communication and network systems, information security, and cryptography/cryptanalysis. At the time of the interview, I did not have the appropriate clearance to even enter their primary facility - I was interviewed off-site, in a remote location, and couldn't go much beyond the lobby and interview areas. However, I was able to ask questions about the type of work I would be doing - the office environment, the tools and technologies, and the problems being worked on (or problems representative of those being worked on). Often, it's not the problems that are classified, but the solutions to those problems and the capabilities generated. I was able to learn enough about what that particular team did to say that I was not interested in the position for moral and ethical reasons. During the application and interview process, you should be able to learn enough about the position to be able to make an informed decision about what type of work you will be doing in the job. And learning about the work environment aspects of the job would be the same as any other job - ask about culture, benefits, opportunities for growth and development. In a government agency, those are often public information since it's consistent across agencies and departments. In a contractor environment, they'll be more than happy to discuss those things, since that's typically an HR topic that applies regardless of the project or program. In terms of politics in the office, I've never encountered that, and when talking to friends of mine outside of the defense industry, it seems pretty similar in nature. I would suspect that this is more of a corporate culture thing rather than something that can be generalized to the defense industry or government contractors. Security at work varies. Most places will provide people with an unclassified workspace in addition to workspaces in classified environments. At my desk, I have nearly free access to the Internet. However, in a classified environment, you don't have this access. Much of the work that I've seen done actually happens in unclassified environments and is then brought into classified environments because the actual, real-world data that the systems operate over is classified. The system itself might be proprietary, and sometimes even open source. As far as getting a security clearance, the forms are somewhat time consuming. You need to often recount your jobs, addresses, friends, colleagues, and family going back 5-15 years depending on the type of clearance investigation. Depending on some of your answers, there might be interviews, polygraphs, and questionnaires to fill out. You can see the forms online, such as the SF-86 ( PDF here ), which is used for DoD Secret clearance (and perhaps other agencies as well - I'm only familiar with DoD)."
1011,"the top line of my resume is ""Rev. Michael Hollinger."" I agree with other posters that this is not a desirable thing to put right at the top of your resume.  It will get you passed over for positions for which you would otherwise be considered. but my real love is my ""weekend job"" as an ordained clergyman I've got a stack of resumes in front of me right now. Here's a fellow with an 'additional' section that list ""Team Captain, Podunk Marathon"" and ""Secretary, Irish Music Society"". Here's another guy with a  'Community Support and Interests"" section.  He does Yoga and rides a bike 50+ miles a week. He's a Deacon in his church. Here's a candidate with an 'Additional' section that lists 'Team Captain, Podunk United Rugby Club'. I see 'additional' sections all the time, and I like them.  It gives me a little more of a picture of the whole person.  As a resume reviewer it's all well and good to screen resumes looking for that candidate who has 15 years of Ruby on Rails and five years of iOS 5 experience.  But it's still interesting to see just a glimpse of who the person really is. Just a bit of 'additional' gives your resume a hook. 'Let's see, I remember, there was an F# guy who was President of his chess club"". In your case, your religious activities are a very important part of who you are.  You don't want to be hired at a place who would find this part of you distracting (and yes, it's not legal in most places for the employer to consider your religion, and we hope everyone follows this principle.) So add your title and part time position as 'Community Service' at the bottom of your resume.  Don't make a big deal about it, but it will be best for both you and your potential employers for this activity to be disclosed."
1012,What is the appropriate way to present a StackExchange profile on a paper resume?. I'm interviewing for technical roles and think that my contributions to StackExchange sites deserve mention on my paper resume. This could be particularly helpful in situations where I'm not working through a recruiter who can provide a true introduction to an employer. What's the most effective way to present this information on the actual resume? Reference URL? Separate section?
1013,"Include this information in an 'additional information' section at the bottom of your resume along with your SE username and a link to your profile. Most reviewers will want to look at a current electronic copy of your resume, so the link will often be helpful to them."
1016,"I totally agree on an ""additional info"" - I usually treat it as a published paper or journal article that way - since I'm not an academic, it's not a major part of the ""what I've done"" section, it's more of a minor highlight. I've also put in a little blurb, as often my reviewer is not likely to be a Stack Exchange user - I generally hover in the space between geek and management, so I have to assume my hiring manager may be quite far away from current sites with day to day answers.  So I often put a blurb that explains why one should click the link: Ranked within the top 20% of contributors in the IT Security Stack Exchange, a Q&A site for IT Security professionals.  Profile found here: <insert URL> Because I always update my resume to send to a specific opportunity, I generally trim and tweak.  For example, my personal contributions to Programmers are quite managerial, as are my contributions here... so I only put them on for management jobs, I may strip it for high level independant contributor IT Security work.  And I keep an eye on my ratings to find a good way to highlight my engagement with the community.  Regardless of ranking, I can usually find something cool to call out. On my most recent job change, after talking with the hiring manager for a phone screen, I got the sense that he was particularly interested in my management style and my take on how teams should be run and what the manager/team member relationship should be.  (It turns out the team had experienced quite a bit of heartache the previous year and it was a major priority to get a solid collaborative manager on the team)  Having gotten the sense of that, I sent a followup thank you email with a link to my profile that highlights my major answers.  I voiced it as: It was great speaking with you yesterday, I liked X and Y and Z about
  your organization.  As we were talking, I got the sense that having
  strong managerial skills is a priority for this role.  If you are
  interested, here is a link to my writing on topics of team and
  management communication <insert link to my profile> . I have no idea if my future boss clicked on it (I'll have to ask him) but it did the trick.  I was the only candidate who got a callback and I got the job.  It's been great! :)"
1017,"I've worked in both the private sector and clearance-requiring defense projects over the course of my career.  I like both, but I would say they are different. There is no ""one size fits all"" in clearance-requiring work.  I strongly advise that you consider each opportunity as it comes up. Here's some points of variation: Security controls required for handling classified information.  The
sensitivity of the information and the nature of the project will dictate this.  It will vary for both printed material and electronic material.  It can be as easy as not taking paperwork out of the space you are working in or as hard as having to lock up any secret information in a safe before you leave. The nature of the work environment - can be anything from a totally isolated LAN to work on a corporate network that is not fundamentally different from any other company.  I have yet to see or hear of a developer position that utterly denied employees ANY access to the Internet for legitimate work-related browsing purposes.  Mileage varies significantly on the definition of ""legitimate"" and the level of network lockdown. The state of the technology.  Unlike the current high profile companies in tech, the defense industry has a VERY long lifecycle.  Equipping an entire service of the armed forces is not trivial.  This is one of the few industries that still has a need for very legacy technology skills - if this is your cup of tea, the resources available internally are often BETTER than the resources on the Internet. Instrusiveness for background check varies by both the level of clearance, the type material being accessed, and the nature of the government branch for which you work.  Be aware that not every war story you hear will apply to the procedures of the process you go through. Things that don't vary - the quality of the people, the quality of the management.  There are incredibly smart people in this industry, and some really great managers.  And there are the polar opposites.  For the most part, the awesome ones tend to keep a low profile and be very laid back... it's not an industry for flashy show-off personality types, as so much of the work is only seen by a limited community. COTS technologies - while there is plenty of speciality code, COTS is as seductive to governments as to private companies.  There are plenty of opportunities to stay on up to date, cross-marketable COTS products. Things to ask before jumping on board options for work/life balance - are likely to be different.  Companies are still looking for creative answers, but some of the physical protections of security are simply not available at home - so like any company - figure out the rules and the corporate culture before joining. the nature of the background check - they should know what level of clearance they want you to have.  And how intrusive that will be.  Also get a sense of how much higher your clearance needs may go.  Often companies will start someone at a lower level, because it is expensive to upgrade clearances and the number of slots at higher levels is not infinite.  So get both the hear and now answer as well as the in the future take. what is the project's technology?  What is the likelihood of shift between projects, and what other technology might be involved?  They can't usually answer a specific ""this project uses X/Y/Z questions.  But they should be able to give you a sense as to whether the whole place is a JEE shop or if it's 10% .NET and 90% VAX programming! What is the response to a security violation?  Everyone screws up once and a while - the big question is what does the company do in response?  Knowing how this works before you go in may help you decide if this work is for you."
1018,"The first thing you need to do is go read ""Peopleware"" It is a mistake to try to change this now.  I was a manager at a company where we had a pretty flexible work schedule.  One of our most productive developers came in at 11am.  He reported to me for a while.  I was told to get him to change his hours.  I fought this request.  Hard.  I was overruled. The result: A less productive, less interested developer who was a huge team contributor.  He became far less productive and useful for the team. All because of some silly notion of ""on time"". Focus more on productivity. Your job as manager is to remove barriers to productivity - not make everyone look, feel and act the same. Flexible hours are a perk - and an employer who allows flexible hours can attract more quality people. As a ""new technical lead"" there is no way you can change culture soon.  Especially in the direction you seem to want.  Have you done anything to improve your team's roles/jobs? Work on building trust with them first.  So many first time managers/leads make mistakes like this. Find out what the other groups REALLY need.  Not ""they have to be here at 9:30"".  Really find out what the issue is.  Then find a solution to that. Instead of telling your team what to do - explain the issue and then ASK THEM FOR SUGGESTIONS/FEEDBACK. You make a vague reference to ""causes a lot of angst between my department and other departments"" - but it is unclear what that angst is - are they upset that devs are treated preferentially?  What is the real underlying issue? I've tried to compel them and it isn't working. There's a reason for that.  And you don't seem to be listening.  Reaching for more drastic measure and bigger hammers are not really going to improve the situation.  Try the ""carrot"" approach instead of the ""stick"" approach. Again, read ""Peopleware"". You are not going to go far with ideas like daily meetings or sending people home or with the notion that they are your minions who need to do as you say, ""or else."" Who is telling you they need to be at work at 9:30?  Other groups?  Your bosses?  You?  Figure out the REAL issue and address that.  When they show up should NOT be the issue."
1019,"The first thing you need to do is LISTEN.  If you listen to the questions or to other feedback you might be able to discover what you are missing. Stephen Covey suggests - ""Seek first to understand, then to be understood."" Are you assuming levels of competence or other knowledge in your explanations? Can you identify common themes in the frustrating conversations/missed communications?"
1020,"Adding a tad more detail to the ""it varies"" answer - know the business, know the culture - demonstrating these things is much more important than resume/face to face exposure. I hire in two roles - engineering/IT & performing arts. Here's a comparison - IT/Engineering: I'm super busy and my own context switch time is critical. I don't want to or have time to hear from individual candidates until they are screened by my HR.  Keeping the business needs going is my job, screening candidate's is HR's job - they and I have had a meeting on my needs and I trust them. Worse, I work in security - a paranoid field to say the least.  If you showed up on my doorstep (past the armed guards, metal detectors and man trap) I might be slightly impressed at your Ninja Skills, but mostly I'd be freaked out.  I'd also have serious concerns about your respect for procedure, which is a critial part of the needs of my team.  And I'd be worried that you don't understand that my particular focus is about building great walls, not climbing over them with impressive skill. Performing Arts: Much the opposite.  Perhaps because our culture revolves around seeing and being seen, the environment is much more open.  It's a strike against the candidate if they haven't seen our group perform -- because why do they want to join an artistic endeavor that they haven't even seen?  Several of my favorite candidates have sheepishly admitted to ""stalking"" us politely for years.  You have to love your work in this industry to be able to do well as a performer.  I wouldn't be suprised to hear that any public facing role was somewhat similar. More to the point - feel free to engage with me at a show, class or other public event.  But there's good ways and bad ways.  Particularly in the performing arts, a good performer makes the performance look effortless.  So there is a fine line between ""interested, engaged, confident and enthusastic"", and the incorrect impression that you can do this job with 0 years of experience better than a practiced performer with 5+ years of experience.  A big part of the culture is dedication to improvement.  As a manager in this world, I have to trust that people will take their own needs to improve seriously, and that people will be willing and open to receiving critique and working on improvement. Always the ""I'm really interested, your work is so cool"" is a winner.  Hard to disagree with that one. :) And even within the more closed tech world - if you happen to see me at a networking event (conference, BOAF session, meet n greet, etc) - and find out that I do something you want a peice of - then absolutely let me know.... that's an appropriate time, because I've intentionally set aside this space for meeting new people and finding out about new opportunities (getting a great person on the team is absolutely an opportunity - for both myself and the candidate!).  Just be aware and open to me asking you to follow a normal procedure."
1021,"Should I list a general ""certificate of achievement"" under my certificates and licenses?. I participated in an Explorers program with a local police department for three years. After each year, they give you this ""Certificate of Achievement"" stating your participation for the year that's signed by the post leaders. My thoughts: This is extremely important and relevant to the job I'm applying for. The only other place where it could really ""fit in"" on their application is under the Miscellaneous section of Additional Information, which seems like a bit of a low-quality place where it might get overlooked. However, you get this certificate just for participating for the entire year (approximately nine months). It doesn't technically show that you put in effort apart from attendance or that you are skillful in anything you've learned. Would this type of certificate be important enough that it would qualify as something I can list there? Note: This is an application , not a resume. This specific application allows you to attach a resume, but the listing states that it will not be considered."
1022,"You've begun to answer your own question by stating that it is ""extremely important and relevant to the job I'm applying for"".  If you think that is true -- for example, if you are applying to the work for or with the police department, or another city agency who would recognize this achievement as something relevant, then it is something you should include. However, be aware that in a general application form, the ""Certificates and Licenses"" section is typically where the company would expect to see industry-specific professional certifications such as the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) certification in some IT fields, or the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification in the field of Project Management, certain licenses for commercial trucking, and so on. When trying to determine if a certificate is ""worthy"" of inclusion in this particular section of a job application, think first if it's something that would be recognized broadly -- outside your location, or outside the application for this particular job.  If not, but is still relevant in some way because it is an achievement that you earned, then I would recommend putting it in the Miscellaneous section."
1025,"How should I properly approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid?. I started working at my current company as a Software Engineer about 2 years ago. When I received my offer, it was $5k less than what was agreed to during my interview and non-negotiable. However I was desperate to get out from my previous job and accepted it. My base salary was 50k when I started and I had about 3 years of prior experience. Meanwhile, a friend who left the company had no experience whatsoever when he started and they started him at 55k. PayScale.com says that I am in the bottom 6% percentile where the average salary for someone in my position, location, and with 5 years experience is about $76k. Salary.com stated just about the same thing. Each year since my hiring I have received a 10% raise, since I do a lot and handle my job well. There have also been 5 people that left my project and the company since I started the job and I inherited some of their work/responsibilities in each case. Based on what I do and the work I've inherited (which entails software, systems, & network engineering, along with some management tasks currently) I feel that I am still underpaid. I've been thinking of asking for a mid-year raise either now or when I obtain my CCNA as I intend to do in a few months. Is my plan of action advisable? How should I properly approach this subject with my boss?"
1026,"A 10% raise is nothing to sneeze at, particularly in the current economic climate. It sounds like your employer already recognizes that you do a lot, and they feel they are compensating you for that work by increasing your salary at a rate substantially above simple cost of living raise (typically 3-5% in the US). Having said that, if you want to negotiate for a raise you can certainly do so.  I would definitely wait until after you complete your certification (CCNA would be substantial value-add), and ideally until your next performance review. When asking for a raise you want to highlight your benefit to the company. Some things to consider are: What major projects have you lead/contributed to? What major business goals have you helped the company achieve? What roles are you currently playing in the company? (you mention a few, but when talking to your boss you want to be able to concretely say you're dong the work of X people/roles) Have you helped the company make (or save) a substantial amount of money recently? What specific job responsibilities have been added to your workload (Again you mention that as people have left you've inherited their work. Quantify this and update your job description to show the new work you're doing). Has any work been taken away from you? (you mention you fill a management role - can you now delegate some of your original job responsibility?) Weigh all of the above, and then think about what you would be worth to the company if you were in charge, balancing all the various expenses. Try your best to come up with a realistic salary expectation. As for how to approach your boss, my advice is to set aside time and let your boss know what the meeting is about (""I'd like to talk with you about my salary"" is a bit blunt, but ""I'd like to discuss my future career path here"" is a good way to bring up the subject. Go over the outline you built using the above ideas, explain what more you want to do to grow in your job, and politely state that you are happy you've been growing in your responsibilities and feel you can do more work but would also like increased compensation to reflect your broader job description. Be prepared for any answer (Yes, I need to talk to someone above me, Not now but maybe in X time , or even a flat-out ""No"") -- think about how you'll handle any of these responsess politely and gracefully. Whether or not you name your target number is really up to you -- I've been fortunate to work for very good bosses, and typically I tell them I trust them to set a fair compensation number, though if that number is less than I am willing to accept I won't hesitate to say something about it."
1028,"There is a saying (I found in my VP HR cabin) : If you do what you always did, you get what you always get. May be this might sound a bit unpopular advise - but it seems to me that your real concern is not appraisal. Say for example instead of 10% they might agree with 15% but over a quarter that is not substantially going to change your lifestyle (unless you are in a very serious bottom of the salary).  Also, organization can't really go over the board and think just about you . But that doesn't change what you are feeling. You have got a very good command over the current job, and looks like you have been there for sometime; you have done good job and you have been appreciated duly by the management in words and at least reasonably well in terms of money. But, it still doesn't seems like you are not on the top of the world - now what? This is a symptom that no incremental progress will keep you happy.  What you are essentially looking for is growth - more so a leap growth. What you should look for is not to get max out of the salary band, that would still be only marginally high. You should essentially look for hunting next level . If indeed this is the problem, here is what you should do: Ask a senior what will be the next level for me. What kind of position, capabilities are involved, and what all choices exists in the practical scenario? Find out what is the essential skills you need to acquire to get qualified there? Ask this in terms of something specific, something you can focus and demonstrate in the current work, specific training etc. Find out what is the horizon. When is the general time frame expected in the company that you will attend there? Some well managed companies might have a clear cut idea, but chances are till you ask them, no one would be sparked with the idea! In essence, you should ask management for next level . Every management feels happy when they see kids have aspirations; and every management gets terribly frustrated when they see kids want so much money quickly. This is a nothing but a paradox in reality, but I have seen this way too often. Instead of focusing on money, you should focus on growth and everything will look nicer. Most often then not - growth will translate into good bucks automatically."
1029,"Is it professional to cut out a middle-man in a contract chain?. I currently work via 2 contracting companies: CompanyA and CompanyB. So the hierarchy is like this: I'm contracted to CompanyA which is contracted to CompanyB which has a contract with the final customer. Now a contract renewal must take place and I was thinking of going directly through CompanyB because that way I'd get a salary raise, as the costs of CompanyA are cut to zero. Do you think it is professional to do this? This is my first contract as a freelancer and I don't know what to do because I feel I might be better with just 1 contracting company. UPDATE-1:
the thing is that actually at some point I was asked if I want to change the contract directly to CompanyB. But that was a previous contract extension, now I'm thinking if it is fair to ask since I initially said I wanted to go through CompanyA."
1030,"Do you think it is professional to do this? NO! But i think the advise doesn't stop there. The point is, Company A is in business for some reason - and for a reason probably better than you because they hired you. The reason can be that including but not limiting to: they are in here for longer times, better relationship with other customers, better marketting/sales network than you have alone, better project management and client interaction framework (may or may not) better terms with CompanyB than you might think initially and perhaps more financial stability which means if contract with end customer goes awary, company A still have some obligation to you if you were not culprit. 
(never undermine this) So you are killing your relationship with CompanyA almost immediately while there is only a small hope to remain connected to CompanyB (which might still take more than couple of project at least. Also, you are turning companyA as your competitor. So it is not truly unprofessional, it does imply betrayal - specially if you are 
yourself a one project company. In general, you can take a step like this, over time, but only when you are largely recognized as an independent name by yourself and if and only if companyB make an offer if they think that companyA is not adding value in the chain!"
1031,"Know that putting such a title on your resume will force many companies to throw your resume away, for the same reason that they are prohibited from even considering resumes with photos attached: potential exposure to discrimination lawsuit. I know personally of companies that have policies like these in place in their hiring. Also, you will get discriminated against by people with a negative attitude to your faith, but I'm guessing that bothers you less. On a personal note: I would be pretty confused by a resume with a title like that, as it has no bearing on the position you are applying for. I would ask myself if this person was really applying for the right job. Based on that, I would not find it positive."
1032,"You claim that you are doing a lot of critical work and your boss is giving you 10% raises which are extraordinarily high raises for most companies. Companies that reward hard work typically do it in three ways: Bonus - lump sum short term reward for effort or performance Raise - Long term reward for effort, performance, promotion, or increase in responsibilities meant to encourage retention.  Typically anything over 2% beats inflation. Perks (Special parking, gifts, additional vacation days, etc...) - Short term reward when budgetary concerns don't allow for raises. When a company gives a 10% raise they are making a significant statement that they trust you, they value you, they recognize just how much you are accomplishing and they really want you to stick around.  This isn't anything that should be too suprising because it seems like they may have a problem with employee retention and they really want to stop the bleeding. You exude feelings of being treated unfairly and that might be related to them promising you one figure at the interview and then taking back their word when they presented the offer.  Fair enough, but consider that a major concern for most employers (especially ones that employ software engineers) is that it is very hard to identify the perfect employee from the incompetent one.  Many deal with this by paying people less and working on a trial period until they have learned to trust you and your abilities.  Again the fact that you get 10% raises more than shows their confidence in you. My conclusion is that you are just overworked and burned out, and you mistake the failed notion that more money will make it more tolerable. It won't. I get the impression that the extra work the stress and the responsibility of your position are taking toll on you and this is the real reason for your unsatisfaction.  Of course as a company it is a lot easier to throw more money at a problem than take proactive steps to remedy the situation by making a concerted effort of bringing on more talent and fostering an environment that encourages natural employee retention. Studies have shown that when it comes to workplace motivation and happiness, salary is not an influence, it is a pre-requisite."
1033,"Generally when 2 companies enter into a sub contracting relationship they also agree not to recruit from each other.  Usually there is significant remuneration required in order to do so.  This makes it unlikely that the prime contractor will be willing to seriously consider hiring you away from their subcontractor. In addition most companies in a contractor arrangement, require that you sign a non-compete in order accept the position.  This document will generally prohibit you from entering into a business relationship with any business partners which would compete with your current employer.  Being hired by their prime contractor fits this.  Some states allow it to be prohibited, while others simply allow for damages.  In this case the damages are generally the full amount they were paid to fill your position. If there is a reason you would need to move to be an employee of the prime contractor you should first talk with your current employer.  Some positions may not be covered by the sub contracting agreement and you may be eligible to move to the prime company. If you are considering the move because you think it will mean more money for the same job, this is unlikely, at least in a significant variation.  Most prime contractors make management fee for handling sub contractors.  But should you become an employee of the prime you will still likely make the prevailing wage for that position.  It is possible that you would even take a cut in pay."
1035,"How common is the use of the polygraph for security cleared jobs?. I asked in a comment to an answer to the question Security clearance jobs: will security make it hard to get work done? whether real life agencies are as enamoured of the polygraph as their portrayal in modern TV drama series' such as Homeland? There were a couple of responses suggesting that the use of polygraphs were quite routine, in the US at least. Given the dubious validity of the polygraph as a lie detection mechanism, I had always assumed that Hollywood played up the role of the polygraph, but now I'm not so sure. While I was working in the UK defence industry, I certainly never had to take a polygraph, and my only exposure since was a business angel who asked me to set up a website to distribute phone based lie detection software, which I was very dubious about. So, how routine is the use of lie detector technology in security cleared workplaces, and indeed has anyone seen its use outside of the defence sector?"
1036,"This answer is based purely on your update, in which you said at some point I was asked if I want to change the contract directly to
  CompanyB. But that was a previous contract extension, now I'm thinking
  if it is fair to ask since I initially said I wanted to go through
  CompanyA. Given there is precedent, it would not be unprofessional to politely inquire at contract extension time if the offer to switch to Company B is on the table again. All of the general information in Chad's answer is absolutely true and should be considered; however, in the specific situation where a precedent has already been set, it's not unreasonable to politely inquire about possibilities."
1037,"Responding to thank-you notes from interviewees. I've recently been performing a number of interviews, and many of the candidates send follow-up emails just to say ""thank you"". My question is, what's the best way to respond? All of the following seem bad: something like ""thanks, nice meeting you, cheers"" Too short. something like ""Looking forward to working with you in the future"" Seems to me to be too indicative of a positive outcome, which hasn't been decided yet. ""best of luck with future work"" Seems to me to be too indicative of negative outcome, which again hasn't been decided yet. I should note that I'm not the only one making the decision—there are a number of interviewers, and I'm going to be one of the people providing feedback to the ultimate decision-makers. Any suggestions?"
1038,"If the feedback is negative don't reply (Have HR tell him) If the feed back is good, let him know you guys are interested. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Carol will be getting back you
  shortly regarding next steps."
1039,"I generally don't return them unless I am very sure we are going to offer him the position. These things have a way of changing at the last minute. Some other manager vetoes it, HR finds some background questions at the final step, etc, etc. I have replied positively a few times in the past and have them come back to bite me in the behind. OTOH, I sometimes reply to those that I know WON'T make the cut and offer advice if I think they need/appreciate it. Some of them aren't doing resumes right and I think the advice might help them with another job application."
1040,"I can speak to the US Department of Defense guidelines for polygraph use. The polygraph program is detailed in a document from 1985 , which was most recently updated in 2011 . It specifies, among a number of other things, which types of access require a polygraph investigation. Polygraphs are only used for special access programs , sensitive compartmented information , and by the CIA, DIA, and NSA (sections C1.1.4 and C1.2.2). I'm not sure if numbers exist, but this is probably a relatively small number of people with clearances in the US. In addition, these guidelines ensure that polygraph results can not be the only reason for rejecting a candidate. This leads me to believe that it is recognized that it isn't the most accurate tool, but that it can provide insight to investigators when looking at people who would be handling information that can, in the wrong hands, be the most damaging to US interests."
1041,"In situations in which I am on a committee, and I receive thank you notes from individuals, I do not respond.  The only instance in which I would respond would be if I were the committee chair. When I do respond, as either committee manager or as an individual interviewer (when there's no committee), I keep my acknowledgement brief (and I only respond if it's an emailed thank-you): ""Thank you for your interest, and for taking the time to talk with us about the position.  Our decision timeline is..."""
1042,"There were a couple of responses suggesting that the use of polygraphs were quite routine, in the US at least.  Given the dubious validity of the polygraph as a lie detection mechanism, I had always assumed that Hollywood played up the role of the polygraph, but now I'm not so sure. The results of a polygraph are used as a means to determine the general truthfulness of your statements.  Often times the results of a polygraph can be accepted by a court of law on this premise. So, how routine is the use of lie detector technology in security cleared workplaces, and indeed has anyone seen its use outside of the defence sector? I really want to expand the comment I made, in the linked question, with regards to federal employement.  The polygraph would be used to determine the truthfulness of your answers based on questions raised by the information you provided as a means to verify your background. The example I used was timeframes where you didn't reference people, whom that can be contacted by said investigator, or whom provided answers that were say not flattering. So, how routine is the use of lie detector technology in security cleared workplaces, and indeed has anyone seen its use outside of the defence sector? The same agency handles ALL United States Government Security Clearance Requests.  So if a security clearance is required for the job, the use of a polygraph is the same, the entire process is the same.  There are additional steps the agency that handles the security background checks simply provide a recomendation at the end of the process. As I have mentioned I have personal experience with this process, the exact details are not important, I should add the process is public knowlege."
1043,"I hit this one too - I've stared at a blank page for up to 20 minutes thinking ""geez, a simple ""your welcome"" should not be so hard!"" I agree that 2 out of 3 of your samples are too indicative.  Sadly, in this day and age, it seems we have to be very careful at anything that sounds like a commitment. Here's some stuff I've felt OK with: I enjoyed speaking with you, as well, thanks for following up! - and I have some permutations of these that are less positive in cases where it really wasn't great speaking with the person (in fact I wanted that hour of my life back) - things like ""it's always enlightening to get to meet new people"". Adding in more details about the follow up process - particularly if we did not have that conversation at the interview (frequently I let HR do it). Answering any factual questions asked, or providing more info about a discussion point.  My absolute favorite candidates are always people who prompted me to go do some research or thinking about the topics (this is like the top 10% people), and so I may mail back with - ""you got me thinking about X, did you know about Y?""  NOTE: These people are probably so awesome that I want to keep in touch, even if they don't come to work for me... networks are good! Things I avoid: any positive or negative impressions that could later evoke some presumption on the candidate's part any feedback on the interview - I leave that to HR. any information about other candidates, or my opinions on the hiring process, or the relative urgency of filling the position."
1044,"In practice, this question is pretty hard to answer from a single person perspective.  No single person's experience is likely to cover the spectrum and the actual practice of polygraph usage is generally considered sensitive enough that I would consider most Internet responses worth a grain of salt.  I know people for whom work is completely impossible without a polygraph, and I know people who have remained very gainfully employed in interesting, marketable and engaging work in the defense industry without submitting to a polygraph, in fact they've actually been asked and said ""no"".  There are also some variations on what ""taking a polygraph"" means and they change over the years. Sorry to be negative.  I love @Thomas Owens answer - as he's nailed the actual DOD guidelines for this. Speaking very, very generally - the use of a polygraph is correlated to the specific agency's determination of the security risk of the information being handled and the security controls that are most appropriate to mitigating that risk.  While there is a single agency that handles clearance investigations, they are not the group responsible for deciding risk and the adequacy of security controls - that is handled by the owner of the data and the group responsible for the project that uses the data.  (check out NIST standards relating to risk management and security controls) To make conjectures about which agencies and what types of information or how prevalent this aspect of clearance application is would be a problematic endeavor - particularly on a public forum. I can say from personal experience, that the ad hoc, free and easy use of a polygraph as seen in crime shows is anything but the truth of how they are actually used.  Polygraphs (and any biological based truth detection mechanism) treads very closely to the US cultural norm of protection of privacy from government scrutiny (even when the subject is working for the government) and it's treated very, very cautiously and with a fairly rigorous procedure. About the best thing to do is to avoid the hype and ask the question when doing the interview.  Don't expect that you know based on a previous interview or job experience that the jargon being mentioned raises a standard set of expectations about the background check process."
1045,Thank you notes are considered a one way message with no requirement or expectation of a response when received. They are a token sign of grattitude and a last attempt to make a postive impression on the interviewer. Unless of course the sender asked you a question or made a statement that you decide you would like them to explain more.
1046,"How can I force a former employer (and family friend) to pay me without creating too much conflict?. I worked for a web-design company for about 9 months, and was laid off almost 6 months ago, because my employer was unable to continue to afford to pay me. At the time, he was behind on payment for a quite significant (several grand) sum of money. As of right now, I am still owed that money. Every time I call to ask for the money I'm owed, I always get the answer ""I am waiting for a check to come in, and I will have your money by the end of the week"" So far, it has been 6 months, and apparently, the ""week"" isn't over yet. The employer is a family friend, and I know he means well, so I don't want to involve a lawsuit, but I still want to get my money. So for my question: How can I convince him to (actually) give me the money, without causing any legal trouble or significant strain on the relationship? Edit: As for jcmeloni's comment , it was basically a summer job (only a little longer...), he never actually had me sign a contract (I'm 18, and it was my first job, so I didn't think to make him write one), however he had agreed to pay me at a rate of $15 an hour."
1047,"Frankly, it sounds like your former employer is abusing his family friend status to get out of paying you. He's essentially stealing a large amount of money from you. You're not the bad guy for wanting to be paid. Give him a final warning, with a very short deadline and then do whatever you'd do if he was not a family friend."
1048,"here's the process I'd go through: Know your Worth What are your peers in the industry making? - not just ""software"" but in the specific technologies and in the business sector in which you are working. Can you get a more competitive offer?  Not always worth the time it takes to interview and get an offer in hand, but before you demand over the top money, you may want this. The 5 people who left - what are they making now? A low offer and then 10% raises per year says to me that they do value you - at least in my region and technology domain 10% is quite generous - it's on the ""top performer"" end of things. The goal is to get a bit impartial and to see yourself as a commodity - not a person.  You, as both an individual and as an employee, have a market rate. In finer grained detail, that rate may also include considerations of personal detail.  For example, when I made a recent job change, I had to account not only for salary, but commute cost & time (varies remarkably in my area), educational opportunities, and other work/life benefits.  I got job offers that were both $10K lower than my current total position, and $20K higher - when you consider their net value and not just the salary (salary alone would have ben -$3K to +$10K). Know what they can Pay Sometimes you don't have to be psychic, this can be talked over with a boss or other trusted senior person in the company.  Before you walk in, you probably want a sense of what they can afford to pay.  If your company is struggling to make ends meet, or needs to pump out a product before the venture capital dries up, the ""I want more money"" conversation may go very badly.  However, reworded to ""I want a better trade off"" may go well - there's more to life than money, and changing the quality of your commute, having better tools for your job, or opportunities to better your life in other ways (more vacation time?) may be even better than money in the bank. Know what it will mean if you leave You may be so skilled and so awesome that you can increase your salary by 50% if you leave.  But the company may say ""OK, go"" - because in their model, they can get another, cheaper version of you for your current salary.  Some business models work this way.  Some companies build in a model for turnover.  They are not necessarily evil, they are pragmatic.  This is something to look at in the big picture - what is turnover like in your company?  What's the culture?  Is there weeping, wailing and shock or a bland shrug of acceptance?  Is the ""employee intake machine"" always humming? Also know what it will mean for you - are you in a place where a change would be good?  Is your skillset up to date or threatening to become obsolete?  Moving every 2 years isn't usually the best solution... but it may be the right time. You don't have to plan to leave just because you want more money - but know yourself before you have the meeting. Negotiate The secret to a good negotiation is that both sides should ""win"".  In a perfect world, each year, you get more money and the company gets a better employee. All this background research is there to position you to have a conversation with your boss that has the tone and the effect of generating this win-win condition.  You don't want to come in defensive or offensive - you want to present a problem and work towards a solution. Problem - you're concerned that your salary is not compartive to the salary you could make elsewhere, so you are missing out on an opportunity to make more money.  You like the company enough to want a raise and continue to work there, you don't really want to leave.  You're aking the boss, cause he knows how to get stuff done, and you want his take on what's a reasonable way to come up at this solution. Be open to whether the expectations are higher than you thought, and that there's other expectations you haven't met - and look for direct feedback on what those are, and how to get there. By being open to the conditions for success, you open up a lot more options to getting a good reward. Set the Scene This isn't a trival discussion.  Money and compensation are generally deeply personal and connected to value judgements and other uncomfortable territory.  Give your boss the opportunity to give you his undivided attention and full focus and prep him a bit.  Things I'd do: set up a meeting, don't just wander in, give it at least a half hour, and hour isn't too bad. find a space with a door that closes (your boss hopefully has an office, but these days, that's not a certainty) start with the closest, most direct reporting boss (in companies with lots of management, this is the guy most responsible for your tasking and day to day tasking) keep it private - if you have a trusted friend at work, chatting amongst the two of you is fine, but don't make it a group-wide conversation. Mileage variation Some of this is definitely US-centric in nature - employee/boss communication, norms about salary, and negotiating tactics are all very culturally dependant."
1049,"I think you have decide which you value more - the family friend relationship or the employment relationship. And it would help to know if he really doesn't have money, or is messing with you. Thoughts: in a perfect world, I try to avoid ever having friends owe me money - the damage to the friendship is usually far worse than the lost opportunity to make money. But hindsight is 20/20 Back him up at the next excuse and say ""you know I have no faith it'll be the end of the week... we've done this too many times"" - and push to find a partial repayment plan - ""can you give me $200/week until it's all paid back?"" Find a trade other than money that will satisfy you - given that it's a friend, you can get oddball - an hour for hour trade - can he do something for you for free to make it up?  or something else.  Just make sure it's worth the value you put on the money. Decide you are willing to risk the friendship and get pushy - call twice a week, call at EVERY deadline.  Be politely annoying so that he feels a subtle pressure to resolve the issue. Back away subtly from family/friend contact with him until it's resolved.  Don't skip stuff you care about, but don't put yourself in a position where a small get together will turn into a sharing of the bad feelings. Backing away includes not doing favors (ie, free work!).  Make it clear that while family friends do friendly favors, they don't welch on pay.  So pay, no favors."
1050,"I wouldn't consider him a family friend if he's able to do this to you, consciously. It's understandable that entrepreneurs sometime get into situations that just suck -- judging by the amount of debt he's in there's most likely multiple people that he owes this money to -- but a family friend should be getting any payments before anyone. I would suggest, before a lawsuit, that you present to him that you're going to pursue legal action and that you're willing to work with him to maybe do a payment plan or even take a cut of what the original amount was to come to an agreement for the payment, and to avoid legal action.  This may scare him enough to actually pay you."
1051,"The etiquette of connecting with recruiters on networking sites. I sometimes get contacted by recruiters on sites such as LinkedIn, asking if I am interested in a job they have available, and they usually want to make a formal connection on the network to share more details about it. I feel unsure about how to handle this: All of the people in my LinkedIn network are people I actually know and work with now or have worked with in the past, and I am not certain it's a good idea to add people to my network based on communication that is based on a single message. On the other hand, I also wonder if I am losing out on potential opportunities because of this. I would like more information from the recruiter, but don't want to formally add them to my network unless I have a real personal connection with them. What is the proper etiquette for handling this situation?"
1052,"Should I reach out for an opportunity via personal contacts or a recruiter?. If a recruiter contacts me about an opportunity at Company X but I find out that I have second or third-degree connections with people there (through personal and professional friends), should I approach the opportunity and discuss it through the recruiter or reach out and make connections via my personal network? Is it okay to sidestep the recruiter and directly reach out to the company (assuming I have not spoken with the recruiter)? For most recruiters that have contacted me, they have all been cold contacts via various networking or job search sites. Though I would like to work with recruiters to find good opportunities for myself, my past experience has not been too memorable and have made me feel like I am at their mercy. With an introduction through a friend, I have found that the response rate has been better and people have been more receptive that way."
1053,"Not sure what the etiquette on this is, but if you have a personal policy of ""I only connect with people I know/network with in the real world"" I'd say that's a Good Thing : it means sharing your network with an employer has more value - ""I know all these people, they all know me, we've worked together and we respect each other."" 1 If you're interested in the opportunity contact the recruiter out of band via email/telephone and express your interest.  Their job is to fill the position with a qualified applicant, and if you're qualified they should be happy to talk to you. If the opportunity pans out (or even if it doesn't) and you feel like this recruiter is someone you like/respect enough to add to your network follow up by sending them an offer to connect.  You are paying them a sincere compliment by saying ""I like/respect you enough to list you in my LinkedIn network. 1 - The reason I don't use LinkedIn is because people seem to connect with everyone who sends them a request: IMHO it's as bad as the way people auto-accept Facebook friend requests and defeats the purpose of a professional network as I can't be sure if your network is ""real"" or if it's just people blindly accepting your requests."
1054,"Customization : Only include information that is relevant to the position you're applying to. That means you will have a different CV for each application. It also means that you need to research your target position and employer very thoroughly and find out what they are looking for. When I apply for a research position, I emphasize my research skills. When I apply for a software development position, I emphasize my IT skills."
1055,"I am thoroughly convinced that you are in no way hurting your career by ignoring their spam, and that is exactly what it is and exactly who they are, spammers . spam  (spæm) — vb  , spams , spamming , spammed 
  1. to send unsolicited electronic mail or text messages simultaneously to a number of e-mail addresses or mobile phones Source: Dictionary.com I not only ignore and delete these requests from my LinkedIn and email, I actively despise them with heated passion.  Anytime an employer posts a new job in my area I can expect, emails, LinkedIn requests and phone calls from at least 3 different recruiters all competing for the same pool of people.  No matter how many times you tell them to leave you alone or remove you from their list they will continue to solicit you with impunity.  Keep these parasites off of your LinkedIn profile.  The less they know about you the harder it is for them to contact you. Yet another reason why you wouldn't want them on your LinkedIn profile is because most of these recruiting companies are revolving doors.  You will rarely talk to the same person from the same company more than once.  If you accept everyone of these connection requests your profile will get cluttered with people who moved on to real productive jobs and will drown out people that you have actually known and worked with who can provide the best recommendations and references for you."
1056,"I haven't yet found this to be an issue. For example, I'm connected to a few recruiters, but I'm up front with them and say, ""I'm not looking for a job currently, but if you're interested in meeting up over coffee and talking shop, I'd be happy to meet."" Only a few recruiters actually take me up on this, but the ones that do seem to be the most interested in connecting in a way that goes beyond simply using each other to find employment. This also limits the number of recruiters I connect with. Since I'm not currently looking for a job, I use this network for two things: first, they occasionally post jobs that friends might be interested in, and having met them personally means my friend may have a leg up when I introduce them to the recruiter. Secondly, you never know when you'll next be looking for a job, and like any other role in your industry, it doesn't hurt to have connections when it's time to move. I've heard some people comment that having too many recruiters in your LinkedIn network (or having a high percentage of your total network be recruiters) can seem like you're more interested in finding a job than connecting with professionals in your industry. Whether that's true or not depends on how you use things like LinkedIn, I suppose, but it's probably good advice. As far as connecting with recruiters who might have positions that you're interested in, I don't see any harm in that. You can always remove them from your network if things don't pan out, or they turn out to be more of the ""spamming"" sort."
1057,"You shouldn't have to ""connect"" on a website if there are other means of communication. I've sent message back and forth on LinkedIn with people without having to be connected personally or professionally. If I had to guess, I would guess that recruiters want to connect with you on LinkedIn to see who else they can reach out to and try to place people in positions or sell positions to them. You may be losing out on potential opportunities, but you also don't have to think about it in this way. By choosing to work with a recruiter, you are placing your job search in their hands. In a way, you are giving up control of your life. That's a choice you can make, and the experience can vary from person to person and recruiter to recruiter. By limiting your network to just people you actually know and trust, that gives you the advantage of having a stronger network of people who could connect you to wonderful opportunities in the future. It's a two-way street, and a good sign of the value you hold for yourself and that you give to your contacts. One way I would handle these type of things is to keep your messages brief and concise but also maintain a professional tone. Figure out what the recruiters want to hear from you. You are under no obligation to work with them, and I don't think you want them to take over if you are having doubts about how you want to conduct your job search. It can lead to good opportunities so it might not hurt to bite and see what develops. If the recruiter is someone reputable and someone you can trust, then you can decide whether to add that recruiter to your professional network."
1058,"Both, with an emphasis with the personal connections, and people who are more likely to personally recommend you and speak positively on your behalf. If the personal connections aren't providing enough of the right kinds of leads, then talking to recruiters can't hurt. Just realize that there's a big difference in quality between many recruiters. Spend the most time with the ones that seem to have the kinds of work you're most interested in and/or are able to best connect you to the people who can. Finally, don't forget to give back. Personal connection or recruiter you just met, if someone is helping you look for work it's good advice to be nice to them and thank them for their time, even if it doesn't result in finding the work you want. That's all part of building and maintaining that network."
1059,I got a secret clearance for a job a few years ago.  There was no polygraph.  No one else I worked with needed one for that clearance level. One of the people there was ex-Air Force.  He had to get a polygraph while in the AF as part of his duties but it was a small set of information they could ask about - it was an open ended set of questions.  (There was a technical term for the difference(s) - not sure) In my experience you won't get a polygraph for lower security clearances.
1060,"I'm more inclined to connect, even when I'm not really looking, on the basis that if I establish having a baseline of connections to recruiters, then when I actually am looking, I won't need to have a sudden spurt of connections, which would indeed appear suspicious. I do have a couple filters, though -- I'm more inclined to accept if someone sends a note indicating that they at least glanced at my profile, rather than that I was just a hit on a keyword search.  I'm also more inclined to connect with someone who is local, or is already connected with some former co-workers. The level of requests and notes has never gotten to the point where it's a real annoyance for me, but I may have a higher threshold than others."
1061,"My answer would be whomever you are most comfortable dealing with, and if that is a tie, then to go with the personal contact inside the company. In either case, you would probably want to meet with the person that will be your ""in"", if only so they can be an effective advocate on your behalf.  As someone on the other side, it's a bit uncomfortable when I'm asked to ""put a word"" in for someone I know personally but notr professionally like my daughter's classmates parent, whom I might know is a decent person, but can't vouch for professionally. If you found out about an opportunity from a recruiter telling you about it, I would tend not to work around them to go directly to a company.  It probably won't cause you major problems down the road, but I would feel queasy about it.  If, on the other hand, the open position is publicly available, or you hear about it from you personal contacts, then I would say it's fair game."
1062,"If your contacts are on the team that is hiring, or knows people on the team that is hiring, you're better off going through that channel. Think about it, are you more likely to buy a product that someone you know recommended, or something that you saw on an ad on TV? Now picture yourself as the product, what do you think is the best route to get your customer to buy you? The downside to using a recruiter is that the cost of hiring/contracting you automatically gets bumped by that recruiter's commission. So you're already starting behind the eight ball in terms of salary negotiations (especially when the hiring manager has a fixed budget for his job requirement). Also, don't submit yourself through both channels. You create a headache for the hiring manager who now has to prove to the recruiter that he was introduced to you first through somebody else. That might prevent you from even getting to the interview where the manager might decide you're worth the extra effort. Recruiters are a great resource when you don't have an ""in"" to a company already. Otherwise, just use the connections you already have."
1063,"Is this true? It creates a baseline for negotiation — Gaining a substantial (two-digit-percent) increase on your salary is unlikely. Your prospective employer will think in terms of ""how much more should I give this person so they come and work here?"" and not ""how much is this person worth to me?"". What about large employers who have the power to absolutely require all candidates to reveal detailed salary history? They don't have that power. They can only ask. You can answer ""I will move for x$"" if they don't accept that, say that you will not disclose the sum, but you will move for x$. If they drop you, they don't want you. How do you avoid wasting everyone's time by being completely out of range of what the company is willing to pay? Ask them what they want to pay, for example. There's no reason why they shouldn't disclose their range (and in fact, they do it all the time to recruiters!). Isn't it possible to ""lose"" more by seeming difficult to work with than to simply ask for a generous salary right at the beginning of the discussion (when the recruiter/hiring manager brings it up, of course)? No. At the end of the day, someone from recruitment will bargain with you, but someone from the specific department you will join will sponsor you. In the end, if they really want you, they'll go up within their allotted range."
1064,"You need to make a lightning decision when you first talk to the recruiter. If the conversation starts ""Hi, you don't know me, but I'd like to recommend you for a great senior ABC position that has just come up at DEF"" you have to decide right then if the recruiter is staying in the loop or not. You have one chance to say ""Ah sorry, I have a bunch of contacts at DEF myself so there's no need for you to introduce me there"" or ""Sure, sounds great, and some of those guys know me so I'd like very much to be considered for a position there"". If you go that second way, or if you say you are interested before you hear where it is, then stick with the recruiter. Ask his opinion on talking directly to your contacts and then take his advice. Why? At many large firms if you have been interviewed and then they find out the recruiter talked to you at some point, they may feel ""on the hook"" for the recruiters fee, or vulnerable to some sort of claim from the recruiter, if they hire you. Generally the way they deal with that is not to hire you. I have seen it happen. So there is more at stake than just ""the recruiter might be mad that he didn't get a commission from my hiring."" Usually, if you tell a recruiter who is representing you that you have contacts of your own they are more than happy to advise you on how best to take advantage of that. If you don't trust a recruiter and don't feel you would be well represented, don't have that recruiter represent you. But understand your choice to do that may eliminate certain positions for you."
1065,"Since your premise appears to be that the recruiter contacted you first , then you later found out that you have contacts at that business, inform the recruiter you've contracted with about those connections, and proceed according to your recruiter's instructions. Usually, they'll encourage you to reach out; it's improving your odds of landing a job, and thus their odds of getting paid. Having personal connections is great, and can be great for landing you a job. Having already contracted with the recruiter, however, if you pursue the connection through your acquaintances you stand to end up with no job and no recruiter. After all, who wants to work with someone that tries to stick it to them? At the very least, if you don't end up with the job, the recruiter will still be willing to work with you, and will have the feedback from the employer to find a better fit for them and a better fit for you. At our company, we have good, long-standing relationships with certain recruiting agencies. Before they contact their clients, they usually contact us and send over résumés, which establishes their claim and gives us a chance to weed out the people in whom we're not interested. Chances are, if you were approached through the recruiter, it's because the company already expressed some interest. Typically, we don't hire people attempting to end-run their placement service – it shows a lack of ethics on their own part, and we're generally willing to pay more for less risk."
1066,"when would it do more good for the person, rather than doing him or her no good? There's no easy answer. On pay, the most comparable issue, the headline statistics for the US as a whole are that: In 2011, among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had
  median usual weekly earnings of $938, while those who were not union
  members had median weekly earnings of $729. As with all statistics, they come with caveats - the full info is here: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm To help you think through it, you need to ask yourself whether you're prepared to make it work: Do you have issues which you and your colleagues have common cause over? This could be wages, but it could be safety, stress and workload, or even just respect. Are they issues which people care about? A union is no good if its members don't care. But if you and your colleagues are willing to be confident and work together, then you can make a difference. Are they issues on which you can make a difference? If your company is about to close down, you may find getting a new coffee machine might not be achievable. But generally, there's a lot that is winnable with the right approach. You can make the case that taking care of your employees is an effective way for the company to foster the trust and innovation that's essential to success. If you have issues which match these three criteria, then there is something you can do collectively. You can try to do it on your own, or you can ask an existing union for help. Think about what's important to you in a union, consider what other workplaces in your industry are doing. It's a decision you and your colleagues need to make together. If you're going into it thinking just ""will it benefit me"", then you need to think about your career. If you're genuinely going to be leaving your job soon, then don't make a half-hearted attempt. But if you plan on working in the same industry for any length of time, then please do consider joining a union. Very often unions on one job end up improving conditions for all jobs, union and non-union in that industry. Finally, if it only evens out for you personally, consider that it might help your colleagues!"
1067,"If you haven't already, set out in writing exactly how much you think you are owed, when it was owed, and mention times when he said he'd pay you that week. It can be a friendly letter just stating what's happened so far, but make sure you have a record and that this is not disputed. Once you're agreed on that, that makes it easier to talk about repayment. If you speak on the phone, follow up with an email to remind him what you agreed in the call. You can be understanding if he's not making a lot of money, but if he's not paying you anything, then he's in breach of a (verbal) contract, and the longer you leave it, the more likely that a) you won't be able to recoup it legally, and b) if he's not recorded money owing, he might be more reluctant to have to explain to his accountant/taxman. Consider mentioning it if you're paying overdraft charges or are otherwise losing out, and explain your needs (though avoid getting into an involved discussion about your personal finances). If you need to be firm, point out he's effectively got a six month interest-free loan already off you without agreeing that beforehand. A ""repayment plan"" should be for more than the value of the original amount owing due to the the risk involved and the inconvenience for you. Finally, do think about what would make you seek legal redress. What if he decided he would never pay you?"
1068,"The employment classification matters: 1099 or W2? If it was as a 1099, it might be permissible and desirable to consider trading the debt via real property of comparable value.  For example, if the employer owes OP 3k, and  employer has a small fishing boat worth 4k or thereabouts, consider taking the boat to satisfy the debt (and of course with a signed title and bill of sale when applicible). Then obviously the OP can choose to keep the real property, or attempt to sell it, possibly for further profit. If it was a W2 employee, this almost certainly wouldn't be allowed."
1070,"Changing employers the right way. I'm currently on the fence about changing employers: I got an offer which is substantially better in payment, at a company which has a much better business model, and which will probably allow more professional growth and advancement. Even if my current employer would be willing to match the salary offer I would very much like to switch. As this would be the first time I'm changing employers I have a few questions: How do I inform my immediate boss/supervisor about the offer? Should I try to negotiate about a matching offer, or should I terminate the contract outright? How do I inform the team? Do I tell them early on, or right as I'm leaving? If it matters, this is in Germany."
1071,"How to inform your immediate boss about the offer My preference is to do this early in the day (when you or your boss arrives): let them know you need to speak to them, and do so alone, preferably in their office. Inform your boss that you have received an offer from another company and intend to terminate your employment (try to phrase it gently like you're letting a bad date down easy, if that makes any sense). Let your boss know how long you are available to finish out any projects (2 weeks is relatively standard in the US, but if you are a major component of a team or a key member of the company a month is not out of line), and if you will be available for occasional phone calls after if an issue comes up. If you are open to counter-offers let them know that as well. Conclude the meeting by handing them a written, signed, and dated letter of resignation stating when you will be terminating your employment.  (It should go without saying, but it is somewhat uncouth to write this letter on your employer's time, or print it on the company printer.) Should you try to negotiate about a matching offer? This is a personal choice: Do you like your current company enough to stay? From your question it sounds like you would prefer to work for the new company, so your decision is pretty well made here. IMPORTANT NOTE Be very careful when negotiating for a counter-offer.  I have seen people given a counter-offer to keep them around just long enough for the company to find and train a replacement, at which point they are fired on the spot. When negotiating a counter offer you are coming to your employer saying ""I'm ready to walk out the door"" - This is not likely to engender any loyalty on their part. How do I inform the team - ASAP or ALAP? Inform your team members / co-workers only AFTER you have formally tendered your resignation to your boss (and if you are entertaining counter offers, only after finally rejecting any counter-offer made). I usually suggest letting your boss mention it at a status meeting or similar, and if you're working for a close-knit team you may want to tell the people who are taking over for you in a private meeting (you, them and your boss). If the meetings thing is not your company culture you may want to tell your team members privately so they're not surprised when you don't show up one day. Stuff you didn't mention: Managing the transition! You're leaving the company.  You won't be there when they have problems. Unless you really hate this company, document the heck out of everything you do ! Make sure that all the obscure bits of knowledge that are only in your head are passed down to someone: Write down the combination to the donut safe, prepare your three envelopes , make sure someone knows to empty the bucket in the ceiling over the secretarial pool that catches water from the leaks when it rains, etc... -- I'm making light of this, but as a mark of professionalism this is critical.  If you walk out and leave the company in the lurch your chances of a good reference from your boss/co-workers in the future is virtually nonexistent."
1072,"How do I inform my immediate boss/supervisor about the offer? Politely, but firmly.  Don't fish for a counter offer.  Stay super positive.  ""I've enjoyed my time here and learned a lot, but it's time for a change.""  It's not you, it's me. :) Should I try to negotiate about a matching offer, or should I terminate the contract outright? Never never never accept a counter offer.   Don't even entertain the idea.  See @voretaq7's explanation .  Repeat as necessary: ""I'm flattered by your counter-offer, but I've decided this transition would be best for me and my career."" How do I inform the team? Do I tell them early on, or right as I'm leaving? As soon as your supervisor says it's ok to do so.  Earlier is better than later.  Then connect with them on LinkedIn so you can stay in touch."
1073,"What is Interviewing? Interviewing is the process by which a potential candidate, filtered from a pool of candidates, is exposed to the concerned authority for a face-to-face, telephonic or any other means of direct or indirect interview, where the Interviewer asks tailored questions to check the skills and ability of the Interviewee . Performance in an interview is one of the measure parameter for selecting or rejecting a candidate for a job. What questions should have this tag? This tag applies to questions about: getting interviews through cover letters and applications. how to best present oneself in an interview. dealing with conflict in an interview. the interviewing process as a whole. the conducting of any interview, be it face to face or over the phone."
1074,Questions relating to interviews and the interviewing process.
1075,"How do I inform my immediate boss/supervisor about the offer? I usually inform the immediate supervisor early in the day, after the morning status meeting. Beforehand, I try to have all my personal possessions out of the office: some companies (especially in the finance industry) will escort you to the door as soon as you give notice, others will want you to work through your notice period. I also try to have a written resignation letter handy. Based on past experience, resignation letters should be 3 and only 3 sentences. I will be resigning my position at $company. My last date of work will be $date. My address is $address. 3.14  Sign and date the letter. Reason for sentence 1: it is a resignation letter, there needs to be zero misunderstanding about what is going on. It needs to be in writing as I've worked for bosses who deny that the person quitting was quitting so as to screw with them starting elsewhere. Reason for sentence 2: I've worked for places that have backdated resignation letters and claimed you quit today - not in 2 weeks. Consequently, you may be expecting a paycheck that you'll never recieve. This is also why you date it with ""today's"" date when you sign it. Reason for sentence 3: Many people move, and if you need COBRA benefits, or 401k paperwork, there have been places I've worked at where they would deliberately and maliciously send your paperwork to an old address so that you cannot reply in the mandated 30 day period (because either it was still tied up in the post office's change of address system, or if that expired, returned to sender). Never ever add stuff to your resignation letter about why you are leaving. It is none of their business. If they ask, answer verbally, but never in any sort of writing. Should I try to negotiate about a matching offer, or should I terminate the contract outright? If they ask, let them bring it up. All the places I've left, I've left for large raises that they cannot and would not match. How do I inform the team? Do I tell them early on, or right as I'm leaving? This is a cultural issue that depends on your workplace's culture. Some want to inform everyone affected as soon as possible, others want you gone with no one knowing you have gone. One book that has a useful chapter on leaving is called Engineering Your Retirement . It is aimed at technical people, and it gives plenty of advice (and equations) to help determine how much is enough to save for retirement. The checklist and advice at the beginning of chapter 8 is what you should keep in mind whenever you depart any employer (due to quitting or getting laid off)."
1076,"Networking for breadth, not depth. While I would not claim to be a professional networker, I do have a pretty strong opinion about what works, and wondering if there is any real research on the best approach to networking. My current belief is that effective networking is based on: Focusing on breadth, not depth; meaning having more connections is better than having a few very depth relationships. To be clear, I'm not saying depth in relationships is not important, just that when it comes to executing a networking strategy that focusing on breadth over depth is more productive. Always establish a connection based on the other parties interests, motivations, preferences, activities, etc. The only exception to this would be if you were hosting an event, or if you were approached by them; but really in both of those cases it's still them expressing their needs. Make their current needs result in them needing to reply to you. Once a relationship is established, then realign the parties interests, motivations, preferences, activities, etc as needed using the response benchmarks measured before the attempt to realign the nature of the relationship. Is there any research that would validate, or dispute, the above approach to professional networking? UPDATES: Re: ""What type of research?"" ( Chad ): Looking for research from researchers like the MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory that focus on sociometric analysis . Re: What constitutes a connection? ( JB King ): A ""breadth strategy"" is a networking strategy that results in connections that enable meaningful responses to requests using the most minimal effort required, but still allows the total number of connections to grow. Types of connections included: to (one-to-one/many), with (many-to-one/many), through (request-is-passed-on-to-one/many). Re: ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"" ( normalocity ): Agree, in fact the wiki-summary for it appears to be well done; though I've read the book before, it would be worth rereading. That said, the objective of the question is not find subjective opinion on the subject no matter how popular/sound it may seem, but to find research that validates, or disputes, the approach; in fact, Carnegie's version to be honest sounds a little more friendly than mine, though I might add it does not focus on the importance breadth over depth, which to me is key to the question. Also, it does not use the benchmarks during the ""onboarding phase"" to evaluate the effect of the attempt to realign the nature of the relationship if needed."
1077,"Is it appropriate to ask colleagues for their mobile numbers on the first working day?. Asking for a phone number right away might be too personal. Should I ask for their phone numbers on the first day, or wait until we really need to contact each other on mobile?"
1078,If you will need to contact them outside the office you would need it for that. However I would not ask for it. If they want you to be able to call them they need to give you the number. Let them do their job and you can focus on yours.
1079,"Automatically measure effectiveness of communication in a virtual office?. I've seen articles on passively measuring and optimizing professional communication that appear to lead me to believe that such systems are both of value, and that people are okay with them being in place. MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory has published a number of papers on the subject, though I don't recall seeing any opensource software that would enable such a system that would integrate with common communication tools in a virtual office . I have found one company that offers service related to Sociometric Analytics , though unable to find any opensource software by them; company also appears to be using MIT's ""Sociometric Badges"" . Any suggestions? (If it's not clear, the basic function of such a system is to passively observe/report on how/who/when/why people communicate, how those measurements match up to other performance data/events/outcomes, and make suggestions on where changes might add value, or reduce lose.  Also, by passively, I mean that this would be done in an automated way that would not change the current way things are accomplished.) EXAMPLE-ADDED: A simple example of the concept would be a call center that uses speech recognition convert speech-to-text, then IDs the speaker, then uses natural language processing software to understand the nature of the dialogs between people as they relate to outcomes the business and customer need relative to the comes achieved by others in the past that took part in a dialog to achieve an outcome of similar nature."
1080,"Any personal details (i.e. personally owned mobiles) in my opinion should not be asked for, they should be given. I would expect it normally to be given/exchanged when a level of trust has been established between the individuals concerned and where they consider it ok to move from a professional relationship to a more personal one. In this case I agree with Michael in that if it comes up that either party needs to contact one another outside of work then they will jointly agree to exchange their numbers. However, having this need on the first day of work seems highly unlikely to me (of course there are always exceptions). And to be honest, I would find it a bit weird (and creepy to be fair) if someone I just met was asking me for my own personal number after only just starting at the company we worked for. Wait until you have gotten to know the person/people a bit better. When you have, the exchange of numbers will just happen naturally."
1081,"I wouldn't ask for their personal contact no. on the very first day, except if someone just joined with me and we had a good talk already. In one of my last office, I was approached by my senior to take contact no. of immediate superior and HR, so that in case of any emergency I can contact them. However I don't think it's a common practice. Anyways your colleagues will exchange the no. when they feel comfortable with you. You don't need to approach them first."
1082,"How can I keep my relationship with an unproductive co-worker who makes me do twice the work?. For the past few months, I have been working with a coworker who, although is smart and hardworking, tends to make me promises which he doesn't live up to. These might be trivial ones like coming early on a particular day, or major ones such as completing his part of the report sooner. A few points: I'm not sure I'd categorize him as lazy, he does do work. Just not what I (or others) ask him to do. At times, he does nothing though. We have no personal problems. Reporting to the boss didn't help because he ended up telling me to ""figure it out on my own"" Talking to him yields more faulty promises ""I was wrong in the past,  I promise to do it this time"" but doesn't. I am not forcing my expectations on him, we cordially split the work justly. Most of the times, I end up doing twice the work (his side and mine) just so that the clients stay happy. At times, he is apologetic and other times he acts as if nothings happened. What can I do to try and get my co-worker to get his work done, without ruining our relationship?"
1083,"Is it good idea to shorten URLs in a CV?. I want to place some links to projects I worked on in my CV. However some of these URLs are rather long. Is it good idea to shorten these URLs using on-line URL shorteners? Is it common practice? Could CV full of URLs like ""http://tinyurl.com/cqvga"" potentially turn off potential employers?"
1084,"Nobody, and I mean nobody will take the time to type in a URL that they see on a printed CV. So, from that perspective I say no because there's no point in putting the URLs there to begin with. If you have an electronic CV, there's no point in shortening them because the user isn't going to type the URL in, either."
1085,"No, I would not recommend shortened URLs in your CV. Whether you're putting URLs to public profiles or to online projects on your CV, it's important to remember that people may or may not click on them at all -- and if it's a paper CV, people are unlikely to type them in -- at least on the first review of your materials. However, what people may look for (and I know I do), is some indication of what those URLs are -- in this case, the domain name is a rhetorical device (it provides ethos).  In other words, on first review of your materials I might not look at your LinkedIn or StackExchange profiles or GitHub repositories (for example), but knowing that you have a LinkedIn profile, you participate in the StackExchange community, and you contribute to or maintain open source repositories means something . If you only use shortened URLs, I have no idea what is behind those shortened links, and thus the information that could be doing some good is doing no good at all. Similarly, assume that I care enough to look at the information itself. If it's an online or electronic CV, I'll click the link; if it's a paper CV, I'll take the time to type the links.  However, if you use shortened URLs, I have no idea where I'll be sent to.  The cost-benefit analysis of typing a LinkedIn or SE URL and knowing where I'm going, versus a shorter link to somewhere unknown, just doesn't work out in the applicant's favor."
1086,"Speaking as someone who deals with this periodically, here's my impression about how I deal with URLs in a resume: I get an electronic copy of the resume and click or copy/paste.  This generally only happens if you are fairly far through our process, since by that point you would have interviewed with HR and gotten through a phone screen. If it is clear you own the site I'll sometimes go to the parent page and see what else you have to say.  This I'll occasionally type in, but I won't type anything beyond ""blog.example.com"" or github.com/yourname. At no point do I type a full path, and I would pretty much never bother to type in bit.ly/whatever.  I might click on it, but then the shortened URL doesn't buy you anything. So the question is, who is your target when you put a shortened URL on your resume?  You are targeting the person who a) wants to see whatever it is you are linking to but b) doesn't have an electronic copy of the resume and c) doesn't care about the information that gets lost when a resume is shortened (e.g., am I looking at a professional blog?) d) is better at typing a shorter-but-random string than a longer-but-nonrandom-string. That seems like a relatively low margin game. Maybe in your industry or area that might be worth it, but I have trouble thinking that it would be a good idea in the general case."
1087,"If you are in a workplace where having each others' contact information is important, then that contact information should be stored in a directory that everyone has access to.  If there isn't already a culture of this, however, it can be very hard to establish one."
1088,"The shortened URLs don't look professional and most people like me don't trust shortened URLs, although tinyurl provides a preview, but I don't think anyone would do extra work for it. Another drawback of using shortned URL is they are case sensitive in some of the site such as bit.ly and tinyurl, and people normally use lowercase while typing the url, ignoring the actual case, so it's another reason to use long URLs. Another point of view may be (not sure if its true everywhere or not) but once an interviewer told me that they treat shortened URLs like internet memes and shorthands (like using 'U' instead of 'you'). If your project URls are too long, you can have a blog explaining your projects and can put the blog link in your CV. Another way would be to buy a good domain name and put a redirect in it. It might impress your interviewer too."
1089,"How to Win Friends and Influence People has some ideas that you may want to consider: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Give honest and sincere appreciation. Arouse in the other person an eager want. Never show others that you are not interested in what they have to say. Six Ways to Make People Like You Become genuinely interested in other people. Smile. Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Talk in terms of the other person's interest. Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely. Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say ""You're Wrong."" If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. Begin in a friendly way. Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas. Throw down a challenge. Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing
  Resentment Begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face. Praise every improvement. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. To apply these points, I'd likely consider smiling, knowing a bit about that person, asking to get sufficient background, and being aware of when could I encourage things to praise the improvements when they come. While there may be the desire to ""Shape up or ship out"" this would likely create an adversarial relationship that will backfire. There is something to be said for respecting what the other person can provide as a way to see the situation different as Stephen Covey listed in his ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" that ""seek first to understand then to be understood"" where there is something to be said for how well do you know all the details from the other person's situation?"
1090,"When you should take the sick leave?? When you think you are sick. I think I am sick now. So take the leave as soon as you can. My employer won't give me frequent leaves. Then change your job. No job or money is more important than your health. You won't see the repercussion now, but they'll haunt you in the future. Just for an example my boss never let any of his employee stay late in the office, because when he worked somewhere else he used to push the limits at cost of his health and now he suggest to everyone to not to repeat his mistake. It's better to learn from someone else's mistake than to make the same mistake and learn. PS: The answer is just a friendly advice, telling what would I have done in this case."

1092,For questions related to the pre-employment screening process.
1093,"Why do you (think you) need a colleague's cell-phone number?  If your job involves possibly dealing with a problem in off hours and needing help, then the company should have a procedure in place for that already (emergency number, rotating beeper, cell-phone numbers in an employee directory, etc).  If that's the case, follow the company procedure. If it's for any other reason, then you probably don't really need that information and should not ask for it on the first day.  If the person has a company-issued cell phone then it's appropriate to ask for that number the first time it seems plausible that you'll actually need it.  (But again, it might already be in a directory.)  If you're asking about a personal cell-phone number, don't; if your co-worker offers it then that's fine, but divulging this information should not be expected.  People should have a reasonable expectation of not being called, on personal phones, for business at all hours."

1095,"Just to add one more approach for those who hit this problem in the future, in the end I just wrote a simple, neutral reply: Dear <person> : Thank you for your note, I enjoyed meeting with you. <my boss> will be getting in touch with you shortly regarding the position. Be well, <me>"
1096,"For the purpose of this answer I am going to assume that you work in a private sector company in a jurisdiction that has some form of 'at will' employment system. If you are in the public sector or in a private company in a jurisdiction that makes it difficult and expensive to fire someone then this answer probably doesn't apply. My experience in the private sector is that there is an ebb and flow of workload in software, it's not unusual to have periods of lower workload.  But it is unusual for a low workload period to extend indefinitely, which is what sounds like is happening here. You need to be concerned about this low workload situation.  It sounds as if your company is profitable right now, but in the normal cycle of business there will be a downturn of some kind. At some point your management will 'rack and stack' each employee based on their perceived value in units of currency to the company.  Those employees with the lowest perceived value will be the first to be laid off. You may well be that person. If you are in an environment where getting another job is easy, there may be great value to you in having a low stress 8-5:30 job. Many, many software related jobs require much more of your time than that.  If you're confident you can move on when the time comes, just enjoy life and if this gig ends go to the next one. Don't worry about it. If, on the other hand, you are in an environment where someone with your background and skill set might have a hard time getting another position then you need to proactively increase your value to your company. To do that, what does your company value?  If your company looks at software professionals as modern day loom operators, expected to  toil constantly at their loom/workstation between 8am and 5:30pm with a half hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks, then you need to do that, even if it means faking it.  Of course this kind of company is doomed in the long run anyway. On the other hand, if you company has moved in to the late 20th century then they may be less concerned with your bio-mass and more concerned with how much you have contributed to the bottom line in the past, and more importantly, how much you can probably contribute in the future. You need to use this slack time to look for ways to improve your company's product, and to improve and streamline your company's software development process.  Try to anticipate what new technologies may be useful for your organization in the future and try to familiarize yourself with them.  Perhaps come up with a prototype of a possible new product. If your organization has periodic performance reviews then that's the best time to bring this up. If they don't, then consider discussing it in private with your manager. In either case, be careful.  You never want to ask a question to which you can't stand the answer. It would be best if you could suggest some tasks you could be doing to help the current or future bottom line during these slow periods. Hopefully you'll get official blessing to fill some of slack hours with activities that will benefit both the company and yourself."
1097,"How should I handle a resume submission that did not occur when I said it would?. A couple of weeks back I discussed submitting a resume for a potential internship with an employee of the company in question, who said he had spoken to the relevant department head and had been told that I should go ahead and forward my resume. However, right after this another individual with 20+ years of work experience looked at my resume and said there were serious problems with it, so I went to straighten it out. Between the two of us (him reviewing it and me making adjustments) it took us a couple of weeks, because he was in another part of the country and worked full-time. My question is: Should I mention this delay in the cover letter? If so, how? Should I tell the truth, or say something like ""I was overwhelmed with classwork""?"
1098,"If the person who mentioned you could forward your resume thought it was acceptable, then you could have just submitted it as-is. If you have a personal recommendation (or at least a personal mention) from someone who already works there, that's going to carry more weight than your resume anyway. As far as the delay, I don't think you need to bother mentioning it; they probably don't care either way so don't over-analyze the situation. If they care why there was a delay they'll ask, and if they do ask then don't lie (why would you start the process off with dishonesty?) - just tell them you wanted to spend a little time polishing it before sending it to them. In the future, I would also focus more on hitting the deadline. To me, seeing that someone does something when they say they will is important. I think it's good that you used a second set of eyes to improve your resume, but it was already deemed acceptable, so why the delay? Either way, it's not a make-or-break mistake. In the long run, probably not a big deal."
1099,"No. If it is generally the case that employees need to contact each other outside business hours, then there should be some sort of internal directory (wiki page, etc.) that has as much personal information as the employees are willing to share.  Asking for access to that on your first day would be perfectly appropriate. If a new employee were to request this information on his/her first day, I would be concerned that he/she was looking to extend my work-time beyond what was established.  Unless this person is my new boss, I'd be hesitant. There may be an exception for some cases -- if you were hired to establish 24 hour support for a product that never had any real formalized support.  Even so, I suspect you could wait until Day 2 to start collecting this information."
1100,"The 5S's are a commonly used practice in "" lean manufacturing "" and apply to workcells that perform highly specified but limited functions in large volumes. Literally moving these concepts outside of the factory floor and into developer's physical offices seems like it could be problematic. As a developer, you're [hopefully] doing different things all the time. Your work is more plastic than any manufacturing operation. To put it another way, does it really matter if the red swingline stapler is on the upper left drawer or behind the monitor? Only if the success of your job depends on stapling efficiency. Certainly, however, one could apply the 5 S's to the software environment: file structure, code conventions, deployment procedures, etc. I think applying it to physical cubicles would really piss people off."
1101,"What kinds of questions are actually asked on a polygraph exam?. I've never personally had to take a polygraph examination before, but I have had a psychological evaluation before (which isn't all that bad at all). The psychological was just filling out a survey, you come back in another day, and the doctor asks you questions about the answers you provided. It was very simple and not mind-wrecking at all. Can the same be said for a polygraph exam? Is the process similar in that you answer questions beforehand and then they ask questions about it, or do they use things you've put on your application? Really the main point is: will it always be something you've directly told them previously, or will they also ask questions about things they've found in your background investigation and other checks that you may not know about?"
1102,"The content of polygraph examinations can and will vary depending on the purpose of the examination, but they are usually limited to simple yes or no questions. There are normally some initial baseline questions (""Is your name John Doe?"", ""Do you reside at 1313 Fake Street?"", etc.) and noise/control questions, followed by the actual ""Relevant Questions"" they want to verify (stuff like ""Have you ever sold illicit drugs?"", ""Have you ever advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government?"", etc.).  The baseline questions are sometimes also repeated during and after the exam. If you are particularly concerned about taking a polygraph (for reasons other than the fact that you intend to lie your way though it), clearancejobs.com has a nice page on taking the polygraph exam - their advice basically boils down to three things: Don't disrupt your routine.  It's a day just like any other, treat it that way. Relax and don't get yourself stressed out about taking an OMG PoLyGrApH!. It's just a machine and a person asking you questions. Be truthful in your responses."
1103,"It depends on the purpose of the polygraph. They will be looking for certain types of information. You covered the major possibilities: confirming info on your application confirming info on a background investigation They will also be looking at items they never asked you about. They may be looking for anything you are trying to hide. Often for the work related poly they will go over the questions before the instruments are on. During the test they only want yes or no answers. They go over the questions early so that you don't start a debate about the meaning of the word ""is"" during the middle of the exam."
1104,"I'm going to break this down slightly differently: Company Contact Information You should ask for how to find it for anyone on the first day.  That includes - email, IM, landline phone, cell phone.  Discussion should include appropriate uses for this information (for example, is someone ""on call"" each night?  Is there a time that is too late?  What constitutes an emergency?). Old school places will keep a list of this information, more modern places roll it into signatures, directory systems, or profiles. The nature of any of these forms of communication is they are provided by the company with the expectation that every employee be able to use it for every other employee. Personal Information Most of the folks I know if in corporate America (mileage varies in other countries) - have two phones - one for home and one for work.  I knew a few old school folks who only carry a work phone, and a few underfunded folks who only carry a personal cell.  But most folks I know intentionally separate home and work life this way... and in some cases it is mandated by their work. Asking for personal information varies significantly from culture to culture.  Here in Boston, I would be reluctant to ask a coworker for personal information unless we had clearly formed a personal bond.  That would be indicated by having made several arrangements to meet up outside of work at purely social, non-work-sponsored endeavors.  Not necessarily anything romantic, but definitely a relationship that has transcended work. In general, to stay on the safe side, I'd be more likely to offer my own cell than ask for someone else's.  Especially if there is any doubt. This is true for any personal information - home email, personal mobile, social network identity, home address."
1105,"Hindsight being 20/20, I'd have made contact with the interested party to tell them that your resume was undergoing a major update, and would it be OK to send it in a few weeks.  This would give the person the opportunity to write you back if the deadline is urgent.  Often entry level positions and internships have very set deadlines and missing them can be a bigger problem than a less than perfect resume. But submit it anyway.  I often submit resumes with three parts:
- an email with a personal note
- a cover letter to the unknown main reader
- the resume In this case, my email with the personal note would include a thank you, your hope that you have not missed a deadline, and a recognition that you are several weeks late.  Don't try to hide it, but don't fall all over yourself apologizing.  Skip detail - but you can say that you were working to improve the resume and getting feedback took longer than expected.  I would avoid any excuses (got busy with classwork) as it implies an inability to juggle multiple demands, where honesty will serve you just fine. But keep it terse - if it's more than 3 sentences, it's probably too long. Then in your cover letter, say nothing of it.  Stick to the good stuff - why you are awesome and why you want to work at this company. The point is that you made a personal contact who deserves the courtesy of knowing why you kept him waiting.  But your contact will pass along this information to someone more involved in the hiring process who neither knows nor cares that your resume was delayed.  So make it easy for your contact to see the apology, but make it easy for your full application to go through the bigger system apology-free."
1108,"Are games and puzzles at your desk a sign of unprofessional immaturity or quirky intelligence?. I am the type of person that likes trinkets, small games and puzzles at my desk.  Typically I have small brain teasers, a couple of Rubiks cubes and a small Chess board.  I also have various other strange and amusing items and oddities (tasteful of course). I recently got in a debate with a colleague who thought that such things were a sign of immaturity and demonstrated lack of professionalism.  He claims that management sees these things and loses faith in their ability to advance and overall will take these people less seriously. My counter argument is that Rubiks cubes and various difficult puzzles demonstrate a passion for solving problems and quirky intelligence.  This person stands out from the pack and others treat them differently in a good way. While my boss thinks it is great that I proudly display my puzzles and has no qualms about introducing me to visitors and prospective clients, I can still sort of see his point. It has been my personal experience that much management in many companies don't like people who are ""too unique"" or demonstrate ""too much personality"", and would rather have a cubicle farm full of unassuming cogs.  Others might think that this person is playing with games and puzzles all day instead of getting actual work done. In all is this something that should be frowned upon or encouraged and why?"
1109,"This is very much dependent on your company culture. I have worked for companies that required any personalisation of the workspace to be work related.  The only exception was professional family photos.  This meant that any ""cute"" things at the desk needed to be related to work, and preferably company themed. I have also worked at companies that forbid any customization of the work space, and one place where we were allowed to have no more than 2 visible items Perhaps not coincidentally the companies with the most restrictive policies towards cube decorations also tended to have significant dysfunction in the work processes. If you are considering implementing these types of restrictive policies please consider the following: A 1% positive increase in a worker's relationship with the boss is
  equal to a 30% increase in salary(when comparing job satisfaction). Psychologists and researchers from
  around the world, including studies by Ed Denener, Martin Seligman,
  Daniel Goleman, Stephen Post, Ruut Veenhoven and John Helliwell have
  all concluded the following: Creating conditions under which workers feel happy about their work results in greater productivity and other positive work behaviours. Happy individuals are more likely than their less happy peers to have fulfilling, positive relationships, superior work performance and
  robust health. Happier people tend to get better performance evaluations and higher pay. Source Most companies I have worked at allowed their workers to personalize their cube as  they saw fit so long as it did not create problems.  Including things that interest you is a way of sharing a piece of yourself with your coworkers.   So long as your interests are not disruptive, I think it is a great way to help improve the work atmosphere. However if you have a coworker that has a problem it may be disruptive for them.  Perhaps a discussion with your coworker could help you understand his concerns.  If his concerns are strictly for your professional development, I would thank him for his concern and emphasize you would prefer to have a happier work environment to slightly greater career success."
1110,"How should I communicate technical changes to a non-technical manager?. I maintain software A, B, C and database D and E. Database D and E are used internally by software A, B and C. I am often get asked by my manager to put xyz functionality in software A/B/C. She does not have any clue how can this be done. That usually requires Adding field to the database adding, modifying stored procedures Changes in the .NET application (actual application) I am not sure how to communicate these changes to my manager in an effective way . For example do I Send email, it is done and describe a brief description of the new functionality + anything else that I did on my behalf as enhancement? Describe the main items in the task as bullets and mark them Done next to it. This would usually be 3 items. Write a detail of of everything thing that I did to complete the task, example created abc field in database D Change stored procedure xyz added stored procedure def change the default year in dropdown z to 2012 Changed styling of dropdownlist on page B Change values of dropbox from 1,2,3 to Jan, Feb, March .. modified code on customerservice.asp which now uses the new stored procedure Link to page 123 added in CM.asp New function added which calculates the value for functionality M. redundant variable j deleted Admin2 permission added to page jkl title of the page changed from this to this Error is now being reported when uploading successful upload is marked by green, errors by red Link ABC moved fro top left and place next to the product field A new utility was created which does the comparison, .... (I did this on my own) The problem with approach 3 is that it can be quite time consuming + is it justifiable to write all that just say, the functionality is done?  Is it efficient use of time? One of my previous manager used to break down the project in these little tasks so a 1 month project would come up with about 40 tasks. My goal is to communicate the work has been completed, and in an informative and professional way. How much detail do I include? Note: My manager is non-IT person but she is expert on business logic and has a good know how of the application and the database."
1111,"So, I would say all of the approaches you mentioned can absolutely work. I would just sit down with your manager and ask which form she wants. Depending on what she needs from you in terms of communication she will probably just choose one of the methods as the form she would like to see for most things that you work on. From there, she will ask for increased or decreased detail depending on the situation, and as trust builds over time (the more things you implement that go well), she will probably ask for less detail, generally speaking. I think the fact that you've taken the time to formalize several different possible communications mechanisms is great. The reality, however, is that everyone is a little different in terms of the kind and amount of information they need or want, so it's really going to be a case-by-case basis. And always in business it's a good idea to ask questions and verify your understanding of what's expected, so there are fewer questions or gaps in what people are actually expecting of your work, and what you think they're expecting. I wouldn't worry too much about the ""show my work"" aspect. Unless your manager is a micro-manager (and wants to know every little thing you're doing, which is possible - some people work this way), then so long as you deliver on what you promise to deliver, everything else tends to fall into place. Finally, it is sometimes the tendency of highly technical people to try to compensate for a lack of technical knowledge in others by providing more technical detail and sending along a list of jargon and other details (I'm not saying that you're doing that here, this is just an expansion on my answer). Sometimes this method works, but more often than not what non-technical people really care about is the business value, the function, and how a particular tool or technical solution is going to fit into a workflow, produce more value for teams or customers, and ultimately the justification for why the technical solution is being implemented in the first place. Ask about that kind of thing, and make sure you're providing not just enough information, but the kind of information your manager/clients/customers are looking for: the goal of this kind of communication is both (a) that they understand that you're acting as a technical expert on their side, in their best interests, and (b) that they understand how the technical solution is going to ultimately help them solve the problems that caused them to seek a solution in the first place."
1112,"If you only provide a summary of what you did in terms of a requested feature ""done/not-done list"", your manager might not appreciate the scope and complexity of the tasks that were requested. Your manager needs to understand, for instance, that a ""simple"" feature request like "" Can we just add a checkbox to this form "" could require multiple changes across multiple tiers and will require testing, validation and deployment. The problem of how exactly to communicate these tasks depends, as normalocity indicated, on what the manager wants or is capable of handling. In any case, somewhere you need to keep track of what you did for each request. If not for your manager, for yourself and other developers. I would strongly recommend that a manager with direct-reports who are developers should be proficient in the usage of bug/issue-tracking applications. Email disperses information too much and makes it hard to figure out what is going on when there are multiple issues. Moreover, an issue-tracker provides a historical record that can be used to answer the question ""what did developer-x do this week/month/year ?"" (valuable for performance evaluations)."
1113,"You need to analyze the current and future needs of your audience(s).  Your manager is one consumer of this information; another is the person who may have to update your code in six months; another is a future manager/lead who needs to understand the state of the system. What tools do you have available?  From comments it seems you have no bug-tracking system; are you in a position to change that?  A bug that anybody in the future can go read is more general than email to your manager, and it gives you one place to record all the discussion (if there was discussion).  Do you use source control?  If so, the check-in comments are an appropriate place for all the details that might be important later, while sparing you from reiterating what the diff reports automatically.  If there's no source control, is there a meaningful change log?  (Per-file, per-module, per-product... you'll need to determine the right granularity, based on change rate and audience.) You should discuss this with your manager as @normalocity suggested.  Understanding your manager's current needs is important.  But you should also consider the other future consumers of this information and try to come up with a write-once scheme that satisfies as many of those needs as possible.  What usually works for my groups is: discussion/rationale in the bug, implementation details in the check-in message, cross-links between the two. I have no citations to offer, only personal experience.  I've been in the software-development industry for many years at small and large companies, and I've helped non-developers (like interaction designers, linguists, user-doc writers, etc) advance from sending email saying ""I put my new files on (file share)"".  Since you're a developer you're probably already fluent in the tools, so it's just a matter of putting them together in the way that meets your organization's needs."
1114,"Writing cover letters when the company is not identified. It is usually commonplace for me to come across a job listing that does not name the company that's looking to fill in the job and just has a list of expected tasks/responsibilities for the job. But every once in a while, one of these listings also states that they need a cover letter along with the resume. There isn't a statement saying what it is the company does. Without much to aid in writing a cover letter for them, I am forced to be more generic in my approach. What should I take out of companies that post an ad like this, since I cannot really tell them how I may apply my skills to their business? How should I write a cover letter when I have very little info to go by?"
1115,"To add a minor point to all of the excellent cautions above: there is no guarantee that a shortened URL is persistent. TinyURL and bit.ly seem to be doing fine right now, but I still remember my surprise when Tr.im shut down in 2009."
1116,"Write to the opening as best you can.  Often when I encounter un-named company job reqs, I do find that there are some indicators as to the industry of the company - for example ""small e-Business"", or ""financial sector"", or something similarly generic. I try to keep the time to write the cover letter proportional to the quality of the job opening description.  I figure that if they only took as much time as needed to jot something generic on the back of a napkin, then I am not going to waste MY valuable time trying to be pyschic. However, often even when the company is not identified, they have clearly spent time trying to put some nuances into the words that they chose to describe the position.  Things I look for that I will speak to in the letter: how much of this job is self-directed?  What examples of that can I cite? what words are they using to describe interpersonal communication skills?  What skills/roles have I held before that I can point to as a good match up based on these words? Any gaps between my qualifications and the job - make it clear that you read the position, know there IS a gap, and how you can either address it, or why it is not a big deal (for example - I don't have Certification X, I have Certification Y - which is all of X's topics and more....) What work/life tradeoffs are listed, is there a useful way I can respond to that, even if it is not a wonderful thing.  For example - ""I thrive on a 24X7 support role, because I thrive on the heroic act of taking responsibilty in a crisis"". Most important to ANY cover letter is proving that you actually have read the posting, and taken seriously the items listed there.  You wouldn't believe how many resumes get weeded out simply because it's clear from the cover letter that the applicant has absolutely no clue about what was listed in the posting."
1117,"First - be clear on why you need to communicate this to the boss.  I can think of three reasons I typically have this conversation with people above or below me: What's it going to take to do this? The before we start conversation.  It's the chance for the boss to say ""not worth it"" or ""go forth you have my blessing"" - they need to know enough in their terms to get a sense of what the group/company is in for when you start.  This can be time to complete, operational impacts, resources involved, or other changes in state that might be unexpected.  Also - are there any risks - stuff that might go wrong?  can we avoid/prevent it? Where are we now? In the moment, where are we with respect to the original chat about what it was going to take and any subsequent conversations.  Is the work going faster or slower than originally expected?  Is there anything new that will impact the outside world?  I've never seen a technical project that went totally as planned - so knowing the unplanned stuff ASAP is important. What just happened? - When the change is done, what can the boss expect?  If the boss knows the business logic, explain it that way - what's going to function differently?  Also, is there any follow up work?  Testing?  Deployment?  Future features that would be good for the to-do list? Any major feature should be described.  Often small cleanup work can be bundled all together and described as one thing. I usually aim to strike a middle ground - I start with the major point with very little detail, and make myself available for more questions.  Over time, I listen for the questions that are asked, and use that as input to building my next report.  Chances are, a pattern will develop and you'll be able to see that the boss always asks questions in a certain direction -- probably a key area of concern for the business. Detail level is a tough trick - different people appreciate different levels of insight.  Because information overload is prevelant, I often try to err on the side of terse - particularly if the recipient is highly placed in the organization."
1119,"When the actual employer is not named, you are dealing with a recruiter who has placed the ad hoping to get a bite from a qualified candidate. In my experience, quality recruiters are retained by the company doing the hiring and will simply name the company in the job description . Job listings where the company isn't named are usually ""long shots"" as far as getting to an actual interview is concerned. If you decide contact one of these (*) do not worry too much about the cover letter for the initial contact. As @bethlakshmi pointed out, only go as far in your cover letter as the job description deserves. If you get the recruiter's attention and they seriously want to present you as a potential candidate, they'll follow-up fairly quickly and tell you whatever you need to know about the job (including the company name and job functions). At that time, you'll have a chance to refine the cover letter as much as you see fit and if you're saavy you might be able to pick up some juicy backstory on the job, the manager, and why they're hiring. Keep in mind that once you've talked to a recruiter and submitted your resume to the recruiter, it is not wise to skip them and engage directly with the employer. Doing so will piss off the recruiter and prevent the employer from considering you. (*) Before responding to the first listing, it might be useful to do a little research. You can do this even with the very slim set of clues provided by the anonymous job description. As I indicated in the comments to the question, ""anonymous"" job postings often have multiple listings with different recruiters. Before doing anything try googling characteristic phrases from the job description and see what you get. Some listings might contain more information or identify the employer. If not then at the very least you can choose which recruiter to deal with. I have even gone as far as searching google maps for office parks in the geographic location mentioned in the description.  Many office parks have the tenants listed. If you're able to rule out dentist's offices, accountants, and car-dealerships , etc, it is not that hard to end up with a manageable short list of possible employers. LinkedIn can often generate clues. Hiring managers who have a decent relationship with a recruiter are likely joined on linkedIn. I forget if linked in lets you see ""third connections"" in some of the premium memberships. Once you get 100+ connections, you have an amazing number of 2nd/3rd order connections. Finally, local business publications, blogs, chamber of commerce newsletters often have articles blabbing about ""growing"" employers who are on a hiring binge (and thus generate many ""anonymous"" listings). Again, it may be possible to ""connect the dots."""
1120,"Before I was a software developer I worked in aviation.  5s type rules are golden for any aviation production or maintenance organization.  Keeping every tool and part in exactly the right place is not just for looks, it's a manner of life and death. I almost lost a friend when a wrench left in an airplane caused a crash on takeoff.  That's why every tool must be controlled and accounted for at all times. Aircraft maintenance is typically done in shifts.  It is a matter of life and death that each incoming shift has no doubt as to the state of the work left by the prior shift.  If shortcuts are taken between shifts then it is very possible that people could die . Creativity is needed in the design process, but not in maintenance or line production. The one thing you don't want in production and maintenance shops is creativity. Everything must standardized, carefully designed procedures must be followed be, rules must be strictly enforced.  Authority must be respected.  Or people die. Software development isn't like that.  Rules that are very appropriate in manufacturing or maintenance organizations are not appropriate in a software development organizations in which individual creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and experimentation are keys to success.  Nobody dies if my monitor and desktop are different than that of another developer.  If the other dev and I are forced to use some kind of authority dictated 'standard' then both of us lose productivity. Attempts to enforce the factory floor regime suggested by this question will drive away all the best software developers and result in only mediocre software products. This 5S system is a recipe for disaster if imposed on a software development team."
1121,"What is the etiquette around discussing interview for new positions with my current coworkers?. I'm not sure what is the etiquette of discussing with coworkers if I am interviewing at other companies... Several days ago, a few of us were standing around and the team lead made a joke that he hoped the upcoming appointment on my calendar wasn't a job interview. I laughed nervously, told them not to worry and changed the subject. I'm not sure if I should have confirmed the thoughts that I was preparing for an interview: On one hand, I fear that if I let it be known I'm interviewing, it could mean that I will only be given tedious production support work because they are worried I might leave mid-project (tedious production support is actually where I am right now, as the main project I'm supposed to transition to might not need me as a programmer for a few more weeks still, and also because someone needs to do it). On the other hand, I know that two members of my 4-person team are contractors and they are leaving in June, and that if I go too, it could leave the remaining guy in a very tight spot. I feel that if I know there's a good chance I'll be leaving, they should know. If I were in their position (especially that of the other full-time guy), I know I'd want to know these things. I admit I feel a little bad about being evasive about admitting if I am interviewing for other jobs elsewhere, but I'm not sure if it is accepted or appropriate to even discuss it, to the point of outright lying if it ever came down to a yes-or-no ""are you interviewing?!"" question."
1122,"Locked in to salary when accepting a long contract extension?. I've been offered a long contract extension after having worked relatively short period. The salary would be the same as before and I'm thinking that if I sign it, I won't be able to negotiate the salary anymore during this long period. The contract will be between me and the contracting company, which then works with a second contracting company, but the second contracting company said they'll want to move me to other projects in a few months. Now I'm thinking they'll move me on other projects but the salary will remain the same while the workload, etc. will be different. I'm quite new to freelancing, so I don't know how to correctly handle this situation. Thank you!"
1123,"You could try to add a clause into the contract that specifies that you have a regular salary review. I would expect this to be annual, so is the contract much longer than a year? You say that you're expecting to move to different projects - this could be an opportunity to renegotiate salary too. However, be careful what you wish for here. A renegotiation could be down as well as up. Most permanent full time jobs usually only offer annual reviews (at best) so a more frequent salary review would be unusual."
1124,"The best answer to the question ""are you looking?"" is ""I'm always on the lookout for better opportunities - and I'm sure you are too."""
1125,"Turn the situation around. While you would like to know if another member of the team is thinking of leaving, are they likely to tell you? The answer to that is probably no. Also - would your employer give you any more than the legal minimum notice that they were firing your or making you redundant? Again the answer is almost certainly no. The time to tell your boss and then your colleagues is the day you hand in your notice. It sounds harsh, but there are far too many downsides (being sidelined on your project being the least of them) to do anything else."
1126,"Don't waste your time concerning yourself with how others feel about your career decisions. You have to put #1 First! When it comes to career decisions and job relocation then you have to be self centered because I promise you that nobody will have any qualms about leaving you behind if they find something better that will further their career. On that note even if that other team member did decide to stay behind for your benefit, why would you want them too? If you truly care about the well being of your team-mates then you wouldn't want them to pass up a great opportunity or willingly stay in a job that makes them miserable if they had an out.  A good friend would encourage that. I understand the emotional turmoil because I have been there, believe me! Almost my entire career was taking a job that I thought was an interesting greenfield or near-greenfield project only to find out that I am not needed on that project or they essentially lied to me and decided to use me as a ""firefighter"" for their flaming flagship software product of dread.  Either that or you end up working in a revolving door company that treats their employees like garbage, causing a brain drain, which causes management to further insist on treating the employees who remain even more like garbage. Been there, that is not software development mind you that is really needing a systems analyst with some programming skills.  You obviously do not want your career to move in that direction so you found something that falls more in line with your long term career objectives. I think you know what you have to do... To answer whether it is appropriate to even discuss this yet then I have found that it is Absolutely a BAD idea to discuss this around peers! Do not talk about your intentions to leave with coworkers until it is OFFICIAL! For no other reason than in what way do you benefit by notifying them of this?  In what way do they benefit from knowing this?  If they would dread the idea you are probably giving them undue worry and grief so that is one potential negative. The other negative is that any one of them could let it slip, people are notoriously bad at keeping secrets.  This can hurt you if your manager gets wind of this. I have even had a company try to swindle me out of paying my unused vacation days because they got wind that my team was aware that I was leaving before I submitted my notice of resignation.  I had to get a lawyer involved to write a threatening letter for them to finally pony up the cash. The absolute professional thing to do here is keep it to yourself until it is official and you have accepted an employment offer."
1127,"In the US most employment contracts are at will.  This means that you can leave the contract at anytime.  The majority of the contracts I have been on had a clause that requested at least 2 weeks notice, but generally the primary penalty for failure to give notice was no longer being eligible for rehire. My experience has been that after a normal time period(6 months - 1year) you can request a rate review and generally receive a bump in pay if there is room between your rate and the companies break even point.  In order to make the best case for this I do my best to keep in contact with my recruiter, and manager at my home company.  Having them on your side when you request a bump is always a plus.  In addition they will know if it is possible or not. I would try to get to a rate where you feel comfortable committing for the entire length of the contract at that rate.  If expenses increase while in your contract explain that to your company.  They are businesses, but they are in the business of managing people. If the company gets a bad reputation for misusing its contractors that is bad for their business.  For this reason, generally, contracting companies build in a buffer so they can give you a pay bump, or other benefit to help keep you happy.  If their customer(the people you are contracted to) see that their employees are struggling to survive it does not look good upon your company.  It is good business to keep you happy."
